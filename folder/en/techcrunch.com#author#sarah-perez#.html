vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

Meanwhile, the addition of Bluetooth means you&#8217;ll be able to pair your smartphone with the device in order to stream music or other audio through the Roku Ultra to the TV.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052236\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052236\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052236\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The updated Roku Ultra adds Dolby Vision support along with Dolby Atmos sound, to cater to customers who have Dolby Vision TVs.

On the player side, the egg carton-sized device is the equivalent of the Roku Streaming Stick+ and works with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The soundbar attaches to the TV via an HDMI cable, and if the TV offers ARC support that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ll need to get started. Otherwise, you can use the included optical cable that comes in the box.<\/p>\n<p>The soundbar has four premium drivers, including two forward-facing drivers to bring out the dialogue and center channel and two on the side, angled to help fill the room with sound. The device will also support Roku features, like the ability to quiet loud commercials, boost the volume of voices, or optimize the sound for night listening.<\/p>\n<p>The device also supports Bluetooth, Spotify Connect, Alexa and Google Assistant, and a voice remote that controls the TV, sound and streaming.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052242\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052242\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052242\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png 7680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While the soundbar is largely being pitched as an entry-level device for newcomers to Roku or an all-in-one solution for use with a new TV, it still allows a customer to expand their home theater setup over time.

With AirPlay 2, customers with Apple devices will be able to stream content directly to their Roku player &#8212; whether that&#8217;s personal content from their own library or from other streaming apps.<\/p>\n<p>The addition will be particularly useful for those times a streaming service launches without Roku support. In recent months, Roku has gotten bogged down in negotiations with media companies now that it runs its own subscription channel platform through its own hub, The Roku Channel. During its negotiations with NBCU, for example, a dispute led to NBCU threatening to pull its TV Everywhere apps off Roku before <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/peacock-roku\/\">the two sides worked things out<\/a>. Today, HBO Max, another major new streaming app, is still not available on Roku. Customers are the ones who really lose in these sorts of battles, of course, so the AirPlay 2 support will be a decent workaround for those times when apps are not available.<\/p>\n<p>Roku OS 9.4 will also bring HomeKit support to select 4K devices so customers can control their Roku via the Home app and Siri on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch or HomePod.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052272\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052272\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052272\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=300,253 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=768,648 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=680,574 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052272\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The update will also bring a new &#8220;Live TV&#8221; tile to the home screen, featuring a live guide to The Roku Channel&#8217;s over 115 free live channels.

Apps can now be stored off screen in the new App Library where they&#8217;re organized for you, as opposed to you being forced to categorize apps yourself into various folders. And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> finally allows for home screen widgets &#8212; a development that left Android users snickering about how &#8220;behind&#8221; their iPhone-using counterparts have been all this time.<\/p>\n<p>But as with iOS apps, Apple&#8217;s design constraints and rules around widgets mean there&#8217;s a standard that all widgets have to meet to be approved. As a result, widgets have a consistent look-and-feel, thanks to things like size limitations and other design guidelines. They can&#8217;t be stretched out indefinitely or moved all over the screen, either.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may have originally envisioned widgets as a way for existing iOS apps to gain a larger presence on users&#8217; home screens, while delivering key information like news, weather or stock updates, for example. But<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/creating-your-own-widgets-a-new-category-of-apps-emerges\/\"> a handful of iOS developers<\/a> instead built apps that allowed users to design widgets themselves &#8212; by selecting colors, fonts, sizes, backgrounds and what information the widget would display.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TikTok users and other Gen Z&#8217;ers began teaching each other how to create custom icons for their apps using Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app. These tutorials were starting to trend even before iOS 14&#8217;s release, but the addition of the App Library and widgets meant users could now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">finally customize their entire home screen<\/a>. That prompted a more enthusiastic adoption of the icon customization technique.<\/p>\n<p>On the Twitter hashtag #iOS14homescreen, users shared their creations &#8212; a showcase of creativity where home screens looked fully themed at last, with custom icons, widgets, decorative photos, matching wallpapers and more. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1308127358038179843?s=20\">The results have been fantastic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And at the top of the App Store, there now sit a trio of must-have tools for this new era: Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget today continue to claim the top three spots on the free apps chart.<\/p>\n<p>Users are also now demanding Apple to change how app shortcuts open. Currently, an app shortcut first launches Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app, which then opens the target app. With the popularity of custom icons, users want that intermediate step cut out.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is aware of the customization craze as it has in the days since iOS 14&#8217;s release run App Store editorial features about iOS 14&#8217;s design changes, suggested widgets to try, creative tools and more. It also featured apps at the top of the App Store, which are benefiting from the trend, like apps offering great widgets, like Fantastical, or those that are booming, like Pinterest &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">recently broke<\/a> its daily download record.<\/p>\n<h2>App makers team up to take on Apple and Google<\/h2>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple\u2019s <\/a>control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google\u2019s control of the Play Store \u2014 a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately pushing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p>On the coalition\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores\u2019 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> allows apps to be side-loaded, so it\u2019s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition\u2019s efforts have to do with Apple\u2019s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 \u201cApp Store Principles\u201d it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store\u2019s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The website is also aiming to recruit new members to join the coalition. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple\u2019s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>Apple responded to the hardball tactics with a barrage of new material and data meant to highlight the benefits of its App Store platform. The company on Thursday <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/app-store-rejected-150000-apps-in-2020-is-seeing-100000-submissions-per-week\">revealed the number<\/a> of rejections it enforces is quite low compared to the number of submissions. It said it rejected 150,000 apps in 2020 but sees 100,000 submissions per week. It also has removed more than 60 million user reviews it believed to be spam.<\/p>\n<p>The company noted its Developer program has over 28 million developers worldwide, whose apps have seen over 50 billion promotions &#8212; meaning when a user sees an app Apple has promoted on the App Store, in emails, on social media or in other general advertising.<\/p>\n<p>However, the backlash has also <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/apple-clarifies-details-on-video-partner-program-for-developers\">forced Apple to be more transparent<\/a> about some of its until-now fairly secretive programs. For example, Apple has <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">now published a page<\/a> that clarifies how its Video Partner program works &#8212; a program that had before only been detailed via background conversations with reporters who then relayed the information to readers. The page reveals the program&#8217;s requirements and that over 130 premium subscription video entertainment providers have since joined. If the guidelines are followed, these providers can pay only a 15% commission to Apple instead of 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Current members include Amazon Prime Video, Binge, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Claro, C More, DAZN, Disney+, Globo, HBO Max, Joyn, Molotov, MUBI, myCanal, STARZ and Viaplay, the website said.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok deal chaos continues<\/h2>\n<p>No, seriously, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">what is going on<\/a> with the TikTok deal?

The move came shortly after WeChat users <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">were granted<\/a> an injunction in a federal court last week that blocked the app from being banned.

But unlike the WeChat case, TikTok is the one asking the court to stop the ban, not its users.<\/p>\n<p>A federal judge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-tiktok-idUSKCN26F35F\">said Thursday<\/a> that the Trump administration must either delay the ban on U.S. app stores or file its legal response to defend the decision by 2:30 PM Friday.

But iPhone home screen customization never really took off until this month, thanks to the launch of iOS 14. With the OS update, developers have finally been able to ship widgets of different sizes alongside their apps to offer a more engaging experience directly on users&#8217; home screens.<\/p>\n<p>While the original intention was focused on bringing informational updates from existing apps to the home screen, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">a handful of developers leveraged<\/a> the new capabilities to build specialized widget design tools. These widget-making apps have allowed users to create widgets of many sorts and sizes, using a variety of colors and styles. Widgetsmith, for example, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/top-20-ios-homescreen-customization-apps-reach-5-7m-installs-after-ios-14-release\/\">topping<\/a> the App Store charts as users began to customize their home screens.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, a number of users figured out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">how to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts<\/a> to replace the icons associated with their favorite apps in order to create entirely unique, themed home screen experiences. Tutorials popped up on TikTok and the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/ios14homescreen?src=hashtag_click\">#iOS14homescreen<\/a> began trending on Twitter as people shared the end results of their iPhone makeovers.<\/p>\n<p>But one obstacle to redesigning the home screen was that you either needed to find a set of custom icons to use or design your own using an app like PicsArt or Photoshop, for example. And this could be challenging for those who don&#8217;t regularly work with creative tools.

redesigns Fire TV, introduces new Fire TV Stick and low-cost Fire TV Stick Lite"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> today announced a redesign Fire TV experience along with an updated Fire TV Stick and a new, lower-cost Fire TV Stick Lite. The updated interface for the Alexa-enabled smart TV platform will introduce a handful of new features, including support video calling and other options for using Fire TV as a way to video chat, including later, support for Zoom, Amazon says.<\/p>\n<p>It also improves the overall design of the Fire TV software experience.<\/p>\n<p>The updated Fire TV design includes a personalized home page where you can more quickly get to your favorite content and apps. It will also support the recently introduced user profiles for up to six people in a household. The profiles allow users to keep track of the shows they&#8217;re watching and see recommendations tailored to their own interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fire TV&#8217;s navigation has also been simplified. Gone is the lengthy row of tabs at the top of the screen to click through. Instead, navigation has moved down the page next to your profile icon, and now includes tabs for Home, Find, Live, and Library, alongside a row of your favorite apps.<\/p>\n<p>The top of the screen, meanwhile, has been freed up to better display a large advertisement for Amazon&#8217;s own content or those from other properties. This is an understandable design choice as it gives Amazon the ability to promote its own shows, but it also takes up a large part of the screen for what may feel like an ad to some customers.<\/p>\n<p>An Alexa hub on Fire TV will help to show off what sort of things you can do with Alexa, including how you can use picture-in-picture mode to watch your smart cameras alongside your TV show. And now, when you ask Alexa a question, she won&#8217;t take over the full screen &#8212; a tweak that recalls Apple&#8217;s recent update to the Siri experience in iOS 14, perhaps.<\/p>\n<p>But the bigger is news is around how Amazon envisions the Fire TV as a communications device.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People have been watching more and more TV at home through devices like Fire TV and we&#8217;ve sold over 100 million of them live today,&#8221; said Amazon VP, Entertainment Devices and Services, Marc Whitten. &#8220;They&#8217;re watching billions of hours of entertainment a month. And they&#8217;ve also been using them for new things &#8212; different things that they hadn&#8217;t before,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>On this front, Amazon is introducing Video Calling with Fire TV.\u00a0 The new feature will allow the home&#8217;s biggest screen to display video calls. Initially, this will work by allowing customers to connect a Logitech USB webcam with their Fire TV Cube to enable two-way video calling on Alexa. Later, Amazon will add support for Zoom, but didn&#8217;t offer a launch date.<\/p>\n<p>Though not mentioned today, it seems obvious that Amazon is likely planning to introduce new Fire TV television sets that include built-in webcams at some point further down the road. It&#8217;s unclear why it wasn&#8217;t ready to launch those today at its big event, however.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051641\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051641\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2051641\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg 1624w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=1536,1192 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/download-2-1.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As for Fire TV hardware, today&#8217;s announcements were limited to Fire TV Stick.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire TV Stick is one of Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers and the first product on all of Amazon.com to surpass a quarter of million in customer ratings, the company noted. It now has the most 5-star ratings of any product.<\/p>\n<p>The updated Fire TV Stick has been updated with a 50% more powerful processor, and supports HDR compatibility and Dolby Atmos support for full-HD streaming. But it will use 50% less power than its predecessor, Amazon says. It will continue to ship with the Alexa remote, which includes dedicated volume, power and mute buttons that can control your TV, soundbar and AV equipment. The device will roll out later in the year for $39.99.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also announced a new, more affordable Fire TV Stick, called the Fire TV Stick Lite.

The Kids Edition will now be available with either a tiger or panda design to also make them feel more like room d\u00e9cor.<\/p>\n<p>The devices will also include a 1.6-inch, front-firing speaker, producing crisp vocals and balanced bass for full sound, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> claims.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The actual functionality provided by the new Dot hasn&#8217;t changed as much.

It will offer encouragement when the child is reading well and support when the child struggles, Amazon says. Reading Sidekick at launch will work with hundreds of children\u2019s books and will be available in preview for Amazon Kids+ families in the months ahead.<\/p>\n<p>In another move to cater to parents, Amazon says the Amazon Kids parental controls will be expanded to work all over the house, not just on their Echo Dot Kids Edition. Plus, parents will be able to create an Alexa voice profile for their kids.<\/p>\n<p>Once enabled, Alexa will shift to the Kids Alexa experience whenever it recognizes the child\u2019s voice\u2014on any device in the household\u2014and then provide kid-friendly responses, games, skills, music, and more. Those families who subscribe to Amazon Kids+ will have access to all the kids\u2019 favorite premium skills and Audible books, as part of that catalog.<\/p>\n<p>A preview of Alexa voice profiles for kids will begin rolling out for Amazon Kids and Amazon Kids+ families in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>Echo Dot Kids Edition will be available for pre-order today for only $59.99 and will ship later this year.<\/p>\n<p>The Echo Dot will be available for pre-order today for $49.99 and will ship later this year.

makers band together to fight for App Store changes with new &#8216;Coalition for App Fairness&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google&#8217;s control of the Play Store &#8212; a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>. The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately forcing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/epic-games-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"epic-games-2\">Epic Games, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> for example, is currently involved in a lawsuit against Apple over the App Store&#8217;s commission guidelines. Basecamp&#8217;s launch of its Hey email app led to a public battle between the two after Apple blocked the app&#8217;s updates for its decision to not use Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchase platform. Other app makers in the group have through public statements previously spoken out against Apple&#8217;s practices, and some have also communicated their complaints to Congress.<\/p>\n<p>Included in the new group of app makers are Basecamp, Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, Epic Games, the European Publishers Council, Match Group, News Media Europe, Prepear, Protonmail, SkyDemon, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Tile.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>On the coalition&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores&#8217; 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p>Google allows apps to be side-loaded, so it&#8217;s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition&#8217;s efforts have to do with Apple&#8217;s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, much of Apple&#8217;s success in the app economy can be attributed to its tight controls over how apps are created, designed, reviewed and distributed. Its App Store is purged of junk and spam more often and app reviews are handled largely by humans, not automated tech. Apple app developers also have to abide by guidelines that control how their app should look and feel, what sort of content is allowed and how those apps should behave. Its rules around in-app purchases have also led to a customer experience where making purchases inside an app are as simple as pressing down your thumb or clicking a button, then looking at your phone to complete a transaction.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, however, Apple&#8217;s guidelines don&#8217;t offer much freedom to businesses that have no need to rely on the App Store for things like customer acquisition, search ads or the handling of payments. They may also be capable of hosting their own app and services and their own infrastructure, but have no choice but to use Apple&#8217;s platform to reach iOS customers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As enforcers, regulators, and legislators around the world investigate Apple for its anti-competitive behavior, The Coalition for App Fairness will be the voice of app and game developers in the effort to protect consumer choice and create a level playing field for all,&#8221; said Horacio Gutierrez, head of Global Affairs and chief legal officer at Spotify, in a statement issued by the group on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 &#8220;App Store Principles&#8221; it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store&#8217;s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The members have also <a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/app-developers-coalition-for-app-fairness-competition-innovation\/\">issued<\/a> individual statements, which are available on the group&#8217;s website and, perhaps mostly importantly, they&#8217;ve launched a mechanism to recruit new members. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple&#8217;s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>The organization says this represents &#8220;an open call to all developers, big and small, to join us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Apple didn&#8217;t directly comment on the group&#8217;s launch, but it did today release new resources, including a redesign of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/app-store\/\">About the App Store<\/a> page that details its benefits, the addition of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/app-store\/developing-for-the-app-store\/\">page<\/a> that focused specifically on developer benefits, an <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/features\/\">overview<\/a> of the advantages provided by its app developer program and <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">a new site<\/a> that explains its Apple Video Partner program and how to apply.<\/p>\n<p>Apple tends to not be transparent about some of its programs. Instead, it tends to brief press on background when its rules change (or it say, launches new websites&#8230;), instead of issuing public statements, writing blog posts, or issuing press releases. When reached for comment over App Store issues, Apple rarely goes on record.<\/p>\n<p>But the company&#8217;s inner operations were revealed during the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">recent antitrust hearings<\/a>, which brought to light how it cut a special deal with Amazon, how it determined <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">which apps to commission<\/a>\u00a0and how it handled complex decisions &#8212; like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/29\/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">banning an entire category of apps<\/a> by claiming they were now a privacy threat, instead of offering an alternative path to remain in business.<\/p>\n<p>The backlash over this behavior has been bubbling up for years and is now coming to a head thanks to the regulator investigations. Not all the companies fighting Apple are necessarily in it to save the little guy, however. Had Apple quietly cut special deals with Epic or Spotify too, you may have never heard from them about App Store abuses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against Apple&#8217;s control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google&#8217;s control of the Play Store &#8212; a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months.

This podcasting market is also one Spotify has heavily invested in, with its acquisitions of podcast companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/14\/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million\/\">like Gimlet<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/05\/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content\/\">The Ringer,<\/a> as well as podcasting tools that allow more people to become creators, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/06\/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts\/\">like Anchor.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Audio is by far the fastest-growing medium in the entertainment business, and with over 250 originals and thousands of hours of content, Spotify has one of the largest libraries of unattached IP that exists in the world today and that library is being added to daily,&#8221; said Chernin Entertainment Chairman and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/peter-chernin\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"peter-chernin\">Peter Chernin, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> in a statement. &#8220;This treasure trove of content plus the acceleration of new voices and stories provides an enormous opportunity to transform these addictive stories and IP into content for the screen,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify tells TechCrunch the deal doesn&#8217;t include any commitment to adapt a certain number of podcasts into video projects, but it believes the volume will be high. Specific deal terms were also not being disclosed, including any possible revenue-sharing details. However, the deal doesn&#8217;t prevent Spotify from working with other production companies on programs Chernin decides to pass on. It also doesn&#8217;t specify any marketing or promotional commitments. Those will be handled on a project-by-project basis, Spotify says.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify&#8217;s library of 250 original shows, as well as those it continues to release in the weeks and months ahead, will remain at the center of this agreement, but there may be scenarios where the companies also collaborate on adaptations beyond that group, Spotify tells us.<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to discover what sorts of programs translate well into movies and TV. On this front, Spotify says it believes its diversity of content, ability to analyze data and creator access will be to its advantage.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify original podcast library today includes popular shows across a variety of genres, which is a key asset in this deal. In addition, Spotify will be able to tap into data on how well shows are performing thanks to its prior development of specialized tools for analytics.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Spotify currently allows podcasters to track their own show&#8217;s performance and other anonymized audience data through the Spotify for Podcasters service. Now, the company will be able to use this same data set to help identify possible adaptations that would do well. Because Spotify also owns several of the podcast production companies, it can also help work to identify creators with vision who may be better-suited to help with larger adaptations of this nature.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first time Spotify&#8217;s podcast content has been turned into movies or TV. The company today has nearly a dozen projects in various stages of completion, including the adaptation of &#8220;Homecoming<em>&#8220;<\/em> for Amazon Prime Video, plus upcoming projects like &#8220;The Two Princes<em>&#8220;<\/em> for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/hbo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hbo\">HBO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Max and &#8220;The Horror of Dolores Roach<em>&#8220;<\/em> for Prime Video.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify and Chernin aren&#8217;t announcing any of the first projects that will result from this deal today but, given standard development and production timelines, 2021 would be the very earliest that such content would make its debut.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we believe that the extraordinary growth of audio will continue to attract the world\u2019s great creators and make podcasts a premier destination for original IP,&#8221; said Spotify Chief Content and Advertising Business Officer Dawn Ostroff, in an announcement. &#8220;As we continue to expand our content ambitions, we are thrilled to collaborate with Peter Chernin, who, along with his exceptional team, are the perfect partners to help us share these stories with audiences across mediums and around the world. Together, we can usher in a new era for podcasts as source material,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More Spotify podcasts could soon become TV shows or movies thanks to a new, multiyear partnership announced today between the streaming music provider and film and television production company, Chernin Entertainment.

The company today announced the launch of its own version of a co-viewing feature, which allows friends and family in different locations to watch live TV together at the same time. What makes Sling TV&#8217;s implementation unique, however, is that it&#8217;s allowing for both text and video chat alongside live TV, which is a first for the live TV industry, it says.<\/p>\n<p>The feature, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sling.com\/watchparty\">Sling Watch Party<\/a>, is initially available to existing Sling TV customers. But during the beta preview period, the company says guests will also be able to join a Watch Party by creating a free Sling TV account. However, this free access will only be available through month-end (Sept. 30).<\/p>\n<p>To get started with a Watch Party, users should look for the new Watch Party icon on supported content.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, Watch Party requires the Google Chrome web browser on a desktop or laptop computer in order to work. After clicking to start the Watch Party, users will sign into their Sling TV account if they hadn&#8217;t already, then send out an invite link that allows friends and family to join the Watch Party session. Sling TV will provide a built-in tool to quickly email the link or you can copy the link and distribute in other ways &#8212; like a preferred messaging app, for example.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051061\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051061\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2051061\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png 3528w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=150,93 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=300,186 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=768,475 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=680,421 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=1536,951 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=2048,1268 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/UT-Football_laptop-full-UI-with-chat-beta-badge.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051061\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sling TV<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>At launch, Watch Party-enabled content can be viewed by 4 total participants at the same time. It&#8217;s also not available across all of Sling TV&#8217;s online library or live programming. Instead, the company says that it works on &#8220;most&#8221; live, On Demand and Lookback content, but not local channels like NBC and FOX, rentals, Pay-per-view events, Premium or standalone channels, or programming saved on the Cloud DVR. Standard regional blackouts will also apply.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is supported across Sling TV plans, including its domestic base service (Sling Orange and\/or Sling Blue), Sling Latino, Sling International or any Sling TV Extra, depending on subscription.<\/p>\n<p>That means users can co-watch content from channels like TNT, TBS, AMC, CNN, A&amp;E, History, IFC, BBC America, TruTV, and others. Sling TV suggests the feature would be great for co-watching the NBA Western Conference Finals Game 4 or <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back<\/em> on TNT, <em>The Walking Dead<\/em> on AMC, <em>American Pickers<\/em> on History, or the first presidential debate on CNN, for example.<\/p>\n<p>During the Watch Party session, the content will live stream in the middle of the screen while text chat sits off to one side of the screen (where it can be optionally hidden) and video chat is on the other. Sling TV recommends all users wear headphones for the best experience. Individuals will also be able to control what volume at which they hear each guest separately from the show itself by hovering over a friend&#8217;s video and adjusting their audio bar.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can only host one Watch Party at a time, but there&#8217;s no limitation on how often the feature can be used otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Several streaming services and video chat applications have rolled out co-viewing experiences in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which has limited real-world gatherings. In addition to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\">Hulu<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime\/\">Amazon Video<\/a>, users are co-watching Netflix with an unofficial extension, Netflix Party, and co-watching on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media\/\">Plex<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people\/\">HBO is working with Scener<\/a> to support virtual theater experiences and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together\/\">Facebook just launched co-watching within Messenger,<\/a> too.<\/p>\n<p>For Sling TV, the feature&#8217;s launch may also be tied to hopes of stemming subscriber losses. The company in February posted its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/sling-tv-reports-first-ever-subscriber-decline\/\">first-ever subscriber decline<\/a> as streaming competition heated up. It then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lightreading.com\/services\/dish-sheds-40000-satellite-tv-subs-56000-sling-tv-subs-in-q2\/d\/d-id\/763043\">shed<\/a> 56,000 more subscribers in Q2 as the pandemic took its toll. With the support for temporary guest access, Sling TV may be hoping to convert some new subscribers, as well. But the feature is being offered for such a brief period that users may not have time to make co-viewing the sort habit they later decide to pay for, and instead use it for a one-off co-viewing session of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Live TV streaming service Sling TV is joining in on the co-watching trend.

According to new data from app store market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, installs of the top 20 home screen customization apps reached 5.7 million total downloads worldwide in the first four days following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">the release of iOS 14<\/a> on September 16.<\/p>\n<p>[<strong>Update<\/strong>: While the original estimates focused on Sept. 17-20, the figures were calculated again in the days that followed. Sensor Tower then updated its report with the latest figures from September 17 to September 23. In the seven days following iOS 14&#8217;s launch, the top 20 home screen customization apps reached at least 13.7 million installs and more than $1 million in consumer spending from the App Store globally, it estimates. Widgetsmith, Color Widgets, and Photo Widget remained the top three apps, collectively generating more than 12.6 million installs in that period.]<\/p>\n<p><em>Original article follows:\u00a0<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Remarkably, the three most-downloaded apps &#8212; Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget &#8212; account for 95% of these 5.7 million downloads. That indicates that the rest of the app customization market today is much smaller. But this could still change over time if more apps embrace the trend and expand to include innovative and unique features.<\/p>\n<p>Sensor Tower&#8217;s study on the home screen customization market only focused on those apps that were used to create home screen widgets or existed primarily to service them, like calendars, clocks, memos and others.<\/p>\n<p>To determine if the app offered home screen customization tools, Sensor Tower analyzed the app metadata of all the apps that ranked at any point on the App Store after September 16, then manually reviewed those apps to confirm their functionality was home-screen-customization related.<\/p>\n<p>The report&#8217;s focus was also more on widget apps, rather than apps that helped users make custom icons or existing apps that added widget functionality, as Sensor Tower decided it wouldn&#8217;t be able to determine how many had done so based on their metadata. It&#8217;s also difficult to determine, in some cases, if an app with a larger purpose beyond widgets is moving up the charts simply because it has now added widgets.<\/p>\n<p>The top 20 list, in order, includes the following:<\/p>\n<p>Widgetsmith, Color Widgets, Photo Widget, Photobox Widget, MemoWidget, Home Photo Widget, Motivation Widget, Ermine, Date Today, Hey Weather, TimeDeck, Widgeridoo, Glimpse 2, Widget Wizard, Widget Web, Locket, ItemMemo, OMDZ, Clock Widget for Home Screen and Photo Widgets.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050947\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050947\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050947\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png 1560w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=150,91 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=300,182 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=768,465 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=680,412 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=1536,930 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/home-screen-customization-apps-downloads.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050947\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sensor Tower<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Combined, the group has generated a collective $400,000 in consumer spending in four days &#8212; from September 17 through September 20. Widgetsmith dominated the group, accounting for $370,000 of that total, followed by an app called Date Today with close to $20,000, per Sensor Tower estimates. (We should note Widgetsmith&#8217;s figure comes in a bit lower than some of the other estimates that were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rjonesy\/status\/1308223993443504129\">floating around<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Though Sensor Tower&#8217;s study had a narrower focus, there are signals that plenty of apps have benefitted from the customization craze beyond the widget makers themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Design inspiration resource Pinterest, as noted above, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">saw<\/a> record daily downloads.

This makes it more difficult for a consumer who wants to compare the rankings of all top apps offering home screen customization functionality in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Given that iOS 14 has effectively created an entire new category of apps, it&#8217;s possible that Apple would consider adding a customization category to the App Store in the future, if the trend continues long term.<\/p>\n<p>For now, however, Apple is addressing the discoverability issues with new App Store editorial content. A featured story on the App Store&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; page, for example, is titled &#8220;How to Set Up Widgets,&#8221; and recommends a number of apps that have added widgets &#8212; like Todoist, Carrot Weather, Timepage, Apollo, Spark Mail and others, in addition to Widgetsmith.<\/p>\n<p>There are new widgets still arriving, as well, as developers roll out their iOS 14 updates.

after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/12\/technology\/personaltech\/tested-facebook-reels-tiktok-clone-dud.html\">early reviews<\/a> of the feature criticized its design and <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/09\/22\/instagram-reels-tiktok-facebook-hype-competition\/\">reports indicated<\/a> it was failing to gain traction. The company says it&#8217;s responding to user feedback on a few fronts, by giving Reels users the ability to create longer videos, extend the timer, and by adding tools to trim and delete clips for easier editing.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> helped popularize the short, 15-second video &#8212; its default setting. But its app also allows videos up to a minute in length, which is a popular option. Reels, however, launched with support for only the 15-second video. Not surprisingly, the Reels community of early adopters has been asking for the ability to create longer videos, similar to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>But Instagram isn&#8217;t giving them the full one minute. Instead, it&#8217;s adding the ability to create a Reel up to 30 seconds long. This could force users to create original content for Reels, instead of repurposing their longer TikTok videos on Instagram.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050769\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050769\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050769\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png 1616w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=768,487 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=680,431 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=1536,973 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Trim.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050769\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Instagram<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company says it will also now allow users to extend the timer up to 10 seconds and will allow users to trim and delete clips to make editing simpler.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue to improve Reels based on people\u2019s feedback, and these updates make it easier to create and edit.

With TikTok&#8217;s Sound Sync feature, for example, the app can automatically find music that synchronizes with your video clips, if you don&#8217;t want to take full control of the editing experience.<\/p>\n<p>On Reels, there&#8217;s more manual editing involved in terms of locating the right music and matching it up with your edits &#8212; which you have to do yourself, instead of leaving it up to the tech to do for you.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050768\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050768\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050768\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png 1616w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=768,487 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=680,431 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=1536,973 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Reels-Timer.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Instagram<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Despite being a shameless attempt at being a TikTok clone, Reels lacks other TikTok features, like duets or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/16\/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16\/\">its &#8220;Family Pairing&#8221; parental controls<\/a>. It also makes it difficult to figure out how to share videos more privately. Reels can be posted to Stories, where they disappear, or they can appear on your profile in their own tab &#8212; which is a confusing design choice. Plus, the integration of Reels in the Instagram app<a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html\">\u00a0contributes to app bloat<\/a>. TikTok is an entire social network, but Reels is trying to squeeze that broader creative experience into a much smaller box alongside so many other features, like Stories, Shopping, Live Video, IGTV and more standard photo and video publishing. It feels like too much.<\/p>\n<p>That said, Reels has managed to onboard a number of high-profile users. Today, it&#8217;s touting top Reels from creators like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CFXiMAhjSt5\/?utm_source=ig_embed\">Billy Porter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/blairimani\/\">Blair Imani<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CFPnA7-JzOb\/\">Doug the Pug<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CFK4Lfdldys\/\">Prince William and Kate<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CFS0bQNjtj5\/?igshid=13mdym3wvfzlf\">Eitan Bernath<\/a> as examples of its creative content.<\/p>\n<p>Even though TikTok&#8217;s fate <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/china-says-it-wont-greenlight-tiktok-deal\/\">is still a big question mark in the U.S.<\/a>, it&#8217;s not clear, at this point, if Instagram will be poised to absorb the TikTok audience in the event of a ban.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram says the option to create 30-second Reels is rolling out today, while the new trimming and editing features are live now.

is introducing a new feature designed to make podcasts more interactive. The company says it&#8217;s beginning to test &#8220;Polls,&#8221; a tool that will allow listeners to engage with podcasts by answering questions posed by the podcast hosts during the show. The polls will appear in the Spotify app, and can be found either on the Now Playing screen or on the podcast episode&#8217;s page.<\/p>\n<p>The user can then answer the question and view how their answer stacks up with the rest of the listener base in real time. They won&#8217;t, however, be able to view the results of the poll without first participating themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Participation in polls is entirely optional, Spotify says, and the votes will remain anonymous.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In other words, the goal is not to accumulate individualized data on listeners, but rather give the podcast host a way to better understand their audience. For example, a host could ask the audience to vote on who the next guest should be, or they could ask them to settle a debate that cropped up on the show. Polls will also be able to support either a &#8220;choose one&#8221; or &#8220;choose multiple&#8221; option for the answers, to give them some flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050725\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050725\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2050725\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?w=220\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=49,150 49w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=97,300 97w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=220,680 220w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=497,1536 497w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=663,2048 663w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_NPV.png?resize=16,50 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Podcasts that support polls will only be able to feature one per episode, and each poll can only pose one question. But there&#8217;s no limit to how many total polls the podcast, overall, could include &#8212; the creator could offer a poll with every episode, if they preferred.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the polls feature is only being made available to a small group of beta testers, including <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1lUPomulZRPquVAOOd56EW\">The Rewatchables<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/5XSIvy9cIvYCbfohlNIH71\">Incredible Feats with Dan Cummins<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/5JjwilnP0GTc7WcuAuKlnd\">Crime Countdown<\/a>. Spotify tells TechCrunch it plans to onboard other Spotify Originals and Exclusives over time, as the test progresses. But there&#8217;s no specific ETA or timeline for that expansion, at present.<\/p>\n<p>The test will roll out to most Spotify listeners beginning today, September 23. The full Spotify user base will be able to see the polls later on, the company says. This is being considered the start of the beta because no other podcasts have tested the feature ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first feature Spotify has introduced to make its app the preferred podcast player.<\/p>\n<p>The company has in the past also rolled out support for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/30\/spotify-now-lets-you-add-podcasts-to-playlists\/\">podcast playlists<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/spotify-turns-its-personalization-technology-to-podcasts-with-launch-of-your-daily-podcasts\/\">personalized daily podcast recommendations<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/21\/spotify-launches-a-set-of-editorially-curated-podcast-playlists\/\">editorially curated podcast suggestions<\/a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/spotify-launches-video-podcasts-worldwide-starting-with-select-creators\/\">video podcasts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/14\/spotify-debuts-new-podcast-top-charts-across-26-markets\/\">podcast top charts<\/a>. But where many of its other features were designed to attract users to the Spotify app, the addition of Polls is also meant to cater to podcast creators, not just fans.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify today has one of the largest podcast catalogs, now topping 1.5 million podcasts, thanks to its investments in acquiring podcast companies, like Gimlet Media and the Ringer, as well as podcasting tools, like Anchor.<\/p>\n<p>The company, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-08-27\/spotify-loses-joe-budden-company-s-first-big-podcasting-star?sref=gni836kR\">just lost<\/a>\u00a0one of its biggest exclusive podcast stars, Joe Budden, when it failed to come to terms on a new deal, even after offering the creator a significant raise.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050727\" style=\"width: 292px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050727\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2050727\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?w=282\" alt=\"\" width=\"282\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?resize=62,150 62w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?resize=124,300 124w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?resize=282,680 282w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?resize=636,1536 636w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll_Episode-Page.png?resize=21,50 21w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Spotify has also been facing the downside of its aggressive podcast acquisition strategy in recent days, as it dealt with the backlash over its $100 million exclusive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814\">deal<\/a> with Joe Rogan. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2020\/09\/joe-rogan-spotify-problems.html\">The podcast host had been spreading misinformation<\/a> about the Oregon forest fires, which he later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/joe-rogan-spotify-apology-oregon-forest-fires-antifa-left-activists-2020-9\">apologized<\/a> for.

(Or, at least, this was the most since January 2014, which is when Sensor Tower began tracking app download data.)<\/p>\n<p>On September 20, the firm estimates that Pinterest&#8217;s app generated around 800,000 installs across iOS and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/android\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"android\">Android <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> on a global basis.\u00a0That represents 32% week-over-week growth from the 607,000 installs it saw on September 13 &#8212; a few days before the worldwide <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/ios-14-is-now-available-to-download\/\">release of Apple&#8217;s new mobile operating system, iOS 14<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Pinterest swiftly climbed up from No. 47 on the top free iPhone charts in the U.S. on Friday, September 18 to No. 7 on Sunday, September 20. It then climbed up even further to No. 6 on Monday, September 21 &#8212; a figure that agrees with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apptopia\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apptopia\">Apptopia&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> data. The app may have briefly hit the No. 1 position, as well, but not long enough to be recorded as the No. 1 app for the day.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest is also now No. 1 in the Lifestyle category on the iPhone, though it has regularly taken either a No. 1 or No. 2 position in this category as of February 4, 2020, Sensor Tower also noted.<\/p>\n<p>The Pinterest home page today showcases iPhone design trends as one of its &#8220;Daily Inspirations,&#8221; where the collection &#8220;Trending wallpapers and aesthetic homescreen ideas&#8221; is currently sitting at the top of the page. Here, users are finding iPhone backgrounds and sharing other custom designs and icon sets for people to use in their own creations.<\/p>\n<p>The iOS 14 update has had a large impact on the app ecosystem, as it finally delivered a feature Android users have had for years: home screen widgets.<\/p>\n<p>In combination with the new iOS App Library that lets you hide away less frequently used apps, the iOS update has managed to tap into what was clearly pent-up consumer demand for being able to personalize the iPhone interface to their own tastes and interests. Also, iPhone users are now taking advantage of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Shortcuts app to create custom icons &#8212; although this is more of a hack, as the process isn&#8217;t really replacing the icon itself, but rather creating a shortcut to launch the app instead.<\/p>\n<p>This redesign trend hasn&#8217;t only impacted Pinterest.\u00a0User demand for new widgets and creative tools is now playing out across the iPhone App Store and its Top Charts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Okay but with the new ios release I can finally utilize my dnd pinterest boards.

This April, the startup quickly reacted to government lockdowns and restrictions on in-person gatherings <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/02\/streaming-events-calendar\/\">to focus on helping people find their online counterparts<\/a> and other virtual events, like live-streamed concerts, Zoom parties, esports tournaments and more. Today, those efforts are paying off as IRL announces $16 million in Series B funding and the expansion of its social calendaring app to colleges.<\/p>\n<p>The new round was led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/goodwater-capital\">Goodwater Capital<\/a> with participation from Founders Fund, Floodgate and Raine, and comes on top of the $11 million IRL had previously raised, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/irl-calendar\/\">its $8 million Series A<\/a> last year.<\/p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic, surprisingly, may have made <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/irl-app\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"irl-app\">IRL <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> relevant to a wider audience. Before, IRL was mostly useful to those who lived in areas where there were a lot of events to attend, or who could afford to travel. But with the refocusing on &#8220;remote life&#8221; instead of &#8220;real life,&#8221; more people could launch the app to find something interesting to do &#8212; even if it was only online.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;During the pandemic, IRL actually saw an increase in users after embracing virtual events,&#8221; explains IRL founder and CEO Abraham Shafi. &#8220;IRL is an events social network and we understand that an event doesn\u2019t need to be physical. An event is anything with a date, time and location. So this also includes things like YouTube events, Twitch streams, new music drops, astrological events in the sky and much more,&#8221; he continues.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Once COVID-19 hit and people\u2019s schedules essentially went out the window, we saw an increase in users spending time together through these kinds of events. Now more than ever, people are searching for things to do and people to do them with as they try to orient themselves in this new world,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>In fitting with its new focus, IRL redesigned its app earlier this year to create a new home screen experience where users could discover events they could attend remotely. This design continues to be tweaked, and now features a colorful &#8220;discover&#8221; tab in the app where you can tap into various event categories, like gaming, music, tv, wellness, sports, podcasts, lifestyle and more, including those sourced from partners like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Meetup, Twitch, Spotify, SoundCloud, HBO, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite and others.<\/p>\n<p>There are also dedicated sections for events you&#8217;re following and a curated Top Picks. The IRL in-app calendar, meanwhile, lets you easily see what&#8217;s happening today and in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Since its refocusing on virtual events, IRL has brought people together for online happenings like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/burningman\">Burning Man&#8217;s Multiverse<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/the-weeknd-experience-tik-tok-live\/4SDjD84F\">TikTok Live&#8217;s The Weekend Experience<\/a>, for example.<\/p>\n<p>According to TikTok, IRL had helped it gauge early interest in its The Weekend Experience event, with some 52,000 IRL RSVPs and 1.1 million followers on its IRL profile.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050099\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050099\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2050099\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png 1125w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IMG_5309.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> IRL screenshot via TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL has been an amazing platform for us to engage with more of our audience and meet new potential users,&#8221; said Jenny Zhu, head of Integrated Marketing U.S. at TikTok. She also added that TikTok sees &#8220;major traffic coming from IRL&#8221; and is &#8220;excited to continue our partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of growth, IRL claims its users are now tracking over 1 million hours per day spent in &#8220;Time Together&#8221; &#8212; a metric that tabulates the number of hours users are spending together at the events they RSVP&#8217;d to, virtual or otherwise. In addition, IRL says it has seen 10x growth in daily active users and a total of 300 million &#8220;Time Together&#8221; hours since last June. It also claims 5.5 million MAUs.<\/p>\n<p>While IRL doesn&#8217;t share its download figures, app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimates the app has seen a total of 7.7 million installs across iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<p>With the additional capital, IRL is expanding with the launch of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irl.com\/edu\">college network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Its goal is to improve upon the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> experience for the younger, student demographic by helping college users find, share and attend academic and social events, both physical and virtual. However, just this month <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/facebook-returns-to-its-roots-with-campus-a-college-student-only-social-network\/\">Facebook launched its own college network, Facebook Campus<\/a>, which allows students to privately network and track student events on the Facebook platform, outside of their main Facebook profile.<\/p>\n<p>IRL says it&#8217;s starting its college network with 100 colleges and universities across North America, including Harvard, Columbia and NYU. Facebook Campus, meanwhile, launched with 30 schools. In addition, Shafi says Facebook Campus doesn&#8217;t really focus on being a vertical network oriented around the event calendar &#8212; it&#8217;s a myriad of tools.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL is the only social platform that helps users find the best ways to spend their time and actually encourages them to get off the platform,&#8221; says Shafi about the launch of the new network. &#8220;Colleges and universities, in particular, need a way to build and foster a sense of community, whether their students are away from campus remote learning or on campus practicing hybrid learning,&#8221; he explains.<\/p>\n<p>For IRL&#8217;s investor, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/chi-hua-chien\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"chi-hua-chien\">Chi-Hua Chien, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a managing partner at Goodwater Capital, the potential in IRL is its focus on real connections and community building.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe IRL will grow to become one of the major social networks powering communities on the internet and in the real world,&#8221; Chien said. &#8220;IRL delivers on the promise to make social media less isolating, by helping drive authentic connection between friends and family around events they care about,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Longer-term, the company sees the potential in continuing to connect users to the wider online community of events even after the pandemic has passed. And as users continue to connect to events through IRL, the company aims to make money by getting people off its app instead of keeping them in the app to show them ads, Shafi says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IRL cares about time together. When users spend more time together they create more driving actions, like going to the movies or to dinner, which have a high monetizable intent &#8211; especially for groups. With &#8216;Time Together,&#8217; we make money as users are successful at attending events or get value out of using IRL. It\u2019s a win-win business model,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way a number of companies have had to do business.

href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/area-120\/tables\/\">introducing<\/a> a new work-tracking tool, <a href=\"https:\/\/tables.area120.google.com\/about\">Tables<\/a>, which aims to make tracking projects more efficient by investing in automation. Instead of simply tracking notes and tasks associated with a project in various documents that have to be manually updated by team members, Tables&#8217; bots help do things like scheduling recurring email reminders when tasks are overdue, messaging a chat room when new form submissions are received, moving tasks to other people&#8217;s work queues or updating tasks when statuses are changed.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is designed to be useful across a number of use cases, including project management, IT operations, customer tracking and CRM, recruiting, product development and more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in the technology industry for a long time, including 10 years at Google,&#8221; explains Tables&#8217; GM Tim Gleason, in an announcement about the new service. &#8220;And during my years in the workforce, I\u2019ve always had a difficult time tracking projects. Our teams stored notes and related tasks in different documents. Those documents always got out of date. We\u2019d have to manually sync data between them. And I\u2019d spend a lot of time coordinating between team members to prioritize and update statuses. I spent more time keeping track of work than actually working,&#8221; he says.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049986\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049986\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049986\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=300,203 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=768,520 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=680,460 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=1536,1040 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049986\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Tables, instead, aims to take on some of those extra manual processes &#8212; like collecting data from different sources, collating it together, pasting into another document, then handing it off, for example. The tool, however, is made to work with existing Google technology. That makes it a better choice for those who are already invested in using Google&#8217;s ecosystem, like Google&#8217;s online documents, contacts and more.<\/p>\n<p>To get started with Tables, you can import data from Google Sheets (or a .CSV), share data with your Google Groups, and assign tasks to people found in your Google Contacts. You can also get started with one of the included templates, if you prefer.<\/p>\n<p>The bots handle automated actions, while the data itself can be presented in different ways, like grid views, record lists, kanban boards and maps. Forms allow you to collect data on the fly, without having to give people access to your tables directly.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of its public debut, Tables has been in testing with thousands of active users who are tracking work and collaborating with team members, Google says.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049988\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049988\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049988\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png 3232w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=150,111 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=300,223 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=768,570 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=680,505 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=2048,1521 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Tables is also one of a handful of Area 120 projects to launch with <a href=\"https:\/\/tables.area120.google.com\/u\/0\/about#\/#pricing\">a paid business model.<\/a> Today, other Area 120 projects like ticket seller Fundo, conversational ads platform AdLingo and Google&#8217;s recently launched Orion WiFi also have paid models. In Tables&#8217; case, an individual can use Tables for free, with support for up to 100 tables and 1,000 rows. The paid plan, meanwhile, costs $10 per user per month, and supports up to 1,000 tables and 10,000 rows. This plan also includes support for larger attachments, more actions and advanced history, sharing, forms, automation and views.<\/p>\n<p>The project is clearly meant to tap into the growing interest in no-code, spreadsheet-powered database platforms. A leader in this space, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/airtable\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airtable\">Airtable, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features\/\">recently closed on $185 million<\/a> in Series D funding, valuing its business at $2.585 billion, post-money. Google&#8217;s advantage is that it&#8217;s not a standalone solution that has to work to integrate with other data sources and communications tools. It has the ability to tie into other tools the team is already using to manage their work, like Google Sheets, for example. However, the Tables&#8217; website does indicate the product can work with Slack.<\/p>\n<p>Tables is <a href=\"https:\/\/tables.area120.google.com\/about\">available now<\/a> in the U.S., with both free and paid plans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s in-house incubator Area 120 is today introducing a new work-tracking tool, Tables, which aims to make tracking projects more efficient by investing in automation.

Apple gave its developers less than 24 hours notice of iOS 14&#8217;s arrival this year, even making its announcement before the necessary developer tools (e.g., Xcode) were available for download. That means some developers&#8217; iOS 14-compatible apps weren&#8217;t ready and available on the iOS launch day, as in years past.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the expanded functionality, there&#8217;s another reason to appreciate Launcher&#8217;s new app: Its business model.<\/p>\n<p>The app doesn&#8217;t monetize by way of subscriptions but instead only charges its users a one-time fee for an expanded feature set. While the earlier version of the app had offered two different pricing tiers, Launcher 5 has simplified pricing to just the one.<\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 886px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2049600-1\" width=\"886\" height=\"1920\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Launcher5-AppPreview1.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Its new &#8220;Premium&#8221; in-app purchase will unlock all the new home screen widgets and customization options.

grocery to multiplatform gaming to streaming services and more. But one industry that has not benefited is traditional pay TV. According to new research from eMarketer, the cable, satellite and telecom TV industry is on track to lose the most subscribers ever. This year, over 6 million U.S. households will cut the cord with pay TV, bringing the total number of cord-cutter households to 31.2 million.<\/p>\n<p>The firm says that by 2024, the number will grow even further, reaching 46.6 million total cord-cutter households, or more than a third of all U.S. households that no longer have pay TV.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these significant declines, there are still more households that have a pay TV subscription than those that do not. Today, there are 77.6 million U.S. households that have cable, satellite or telecom TV packages. But that number has declined 7.5% year-over-year &#8212; its biggest-ever drop. The figure is also down from pay TV&#8217;s peak in 2014, the analysts said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049586\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049586\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049586\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg 922w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768,773 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> eMarketer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The pay TV losses, as you may expect, are due to the growing adoption of streaming services. But if anything, the pandemic has pushed forward the cord-cutting movement&#8217;s momentum as the health crisis contributed to a down economy and the loss of live sports during the first part of the year. These trends may have also encouraged more consumers to cut the cord than would have otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Consumers are choosing to cut the cord because of high prices, especially compared with streaming alternatives,&#8221; said eMarketer forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence Eric Haggstrom. &#8220;The loss of live sports in H1 2020 contributed to further declines. While sports have returned, people will not return to their old cable or satellite plans,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Pay TV providers have been attempting to mitigate their losses by shifting their focus to more profitable internet packages, which help power the services that consumers are turning to, like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\">Netflix <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Hulu.<\/p>\n<p>Related to the pay TV decline, the loss in TV viewership is also impacting the advertising industry.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049584\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049584\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049584 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=150,133 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=300,267 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=768,683 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=680,605 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/unnamed-1.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> eMarketer<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Total TV ad spend will drop 15% in 2020 to $60 billion &#8212; the lowest-ever figure the industry has since since 2011.<\/p>\n<p>Some of this is pandemic-related, however, so TV ad dollars are expected to rebound some in 2021.

today is <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/09\/helping-creators-and-publishers-manage-their-intellectual-property\/\">introducing<\/a> a new tool that will allow rights holders to protect and manage their photos across both Facebook and Instagram. With the newly launched &#8220;Rights Manager for Images,&#8221; Facebook is offering creators and publishers access to content-matching technology similar to what it introduced in 2016 to combat stolen videos. The new feature, which is available in Facebook&#8217;s Creator Studio, will allow rights owners to assert control over their intellectual property across Facebook and Instagram, including when the image is embedded on an external website.<\/p>\n<p>As with Facebook&#8217;s existing Rights Manager for video content, creators who want to assert their control over their images will have to provide Facebook with a copy of the images they want to protect, as well as a CSV file with image metadata, as a first step. These are uploaded to a reference library that Rights Manager uses to locate matches across both Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>The creator doesn&#8217;t have to publicly post their images on Facebook or Instagram for this process to work.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When matching content is found on a Page or a profile, the rights holder can choose whether to simply monitor the content, block its use through a takedown request or attribute credit to themselves via an ownership link. Creators can also choose whether or not they want their ownership to apply worldwide or only in certain geographic locations.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049479\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049479\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049479\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg 890w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/NRP-Rights_Manager_inline.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049479\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Facebook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The new feature is designed more for those who maintain a large catalog of images or who post new content on a regular basis. For individuals who only occasionally encounter issues around misuse of their images, Facebook offers an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/contact\/634636770043106\">IP reporting form<\/a> instead, which even allows users to report more than one piece of matching content at a time.<\/p>\n<p>The topic of who has the rights to use a photo that&#8217;s been posted on Facebook, and in particular, the image-heavy site Instagram, has become more controversial in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Many had long believed that embedding an Instagram post on their own website was a perfectly legal use case. But when Newsweek asked to feature a photographer&#8217;s image and they declined, the publication ran it as an embed, <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2020\/06\/instagram-just-threw-users-of-its-embedding-api-under-the-bus\/\">which then opened them up<\/a> to a copyright <a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.524753\/gov.uscourts.nysd.524753.35.0.pdf\">lawsuit<\/a>, filed this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Newsweek had assumed the embed was legally permissible, given that <a href=\"https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/06\/24\/court-reopens-photographers-lawsuit-against-mashable-over-instagram-embedding\/\">Mashable recently won<\/a> a similar copyright case in the recent past. But following the Newsweek case, Instagram clarified that its embedding feature didn&#8217;t include a license &#8212; if someone wanted to use the photo, they would need to ensure they had the proper license to do so. That bit of information came as something of a surprise and the case with Mashable <a href=\"https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/06\/24\/court-reopens-photographers-lawsuit-against-mashable-over-instagram-embedding\/\">was reopened<\/a> as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Until now, photographers had limited means of protecting their content across Facebook&#8217;s platforms. They could only take actions like enabling or disabling embedding entirely or making their account private, for example, to ensure their content wasn&#8217;t used and distributed without their permission. Of course, neither solution was ideal for a photographer trying to gain exposure and grow their career.<\/p>\n<p>The Rights Manager for Images will now allow them a third option, as it&#8217;s capable of finding and matching images that have been used as embeds. At that point, the creator could choose to monitor, block or allow the image as they choose, a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says access to the new Rights Manager for Images will be opened up initially to those who apply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rights_manager\/apply\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook today is introducing a new tool that will allow rights holders to protect and manage their photos across both Facebook and Instagram.
