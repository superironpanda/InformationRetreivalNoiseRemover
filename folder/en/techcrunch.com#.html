vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables. It speaks to the health of the category, and I&#8217;m hopeful the industry picks up tailwinds, and we exit this dystopian period sooner than later.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

They include Taipei-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kkday.com\/en\">KKday<\/a>, which announced today that it has closed a $75 million Series C led by Cool Japan Fund and the National Development Fund of Taiwan.

The latter is especially important during the pandemic because many venues have set up capacity limits.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company says that Rezio has served over 150,000 customers so far, and will be launched in more Asian markets with its Series C funding.

Behind the scene, Multis is a multisignature Ethereum wallet. The company doesn\u2019t control the keys, which means Multis can\u2019t access your funds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a regulatory point of view, it\u2019s been very useful because we don\u2019t hold assets and we can\u2019t review and block transactions,\u201d Sahaghian said.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the multisignature design, you can create an approval workflow so that each transaction needs to be approved by a certain number of people on the team.<\/p>\n<p>Multis supports Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, which means you can also use stablecoins, such as USDC and DAI. This way, you\u2019re not exposed to cryptocurrency volatility when you choose to keep all your assets in USDC for instance. You can swap tokens from Multis directly.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have assets in your Multis account, you can issue payments to employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, etc. You can save addresses and other relevant information to streamline payments in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Centralizing all your crypto transactions on Multi can be useful when you need to file your taxes. You can export all your transactions and hand them over to your accountant.<\/p>\n<p>And if you have too many assets on your hands, you can invest some assets and earn interests thanks to DeFi products. The company uses <a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\">Compound<\/a> for that feature.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, Multis clients are mostly companies working on blockchain products, generating revenue in cryptocurrencies or paying people using stablecoins. But the company wants to simplify its product by adding EUR and USD accounts with cards and IBANs.<\/p>\n<p>Multis could act as a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Companies with offices in multiple countries could use it to save money on intercompany fees. The startup is still working on those new features, but it could lead to some interesting use cases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Q6uPQlDdo9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/\">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/embed\/#?secret=Q6uPQlDdo9\" data-secret=\"Q6uPQlDdo9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Multis, a French startup that is building business bank accounts, except that it lets you store, send and receive cryptocurrencies.

analyze footage captured by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20200324-100-000-cameras-moscow-uses-facial-recognition-to-enforce-quarantine\">Moscow&#8217;s 100,000 surveillance cameras<\/a>, just closed an investment of more than 1RUB billion ($13 million) to further global expansion.<\/p>\n<p>The five-year-old company sells software that recognizes faces, silhouettes and actions on videos. It&#8217;s able to do so on a vast scale in real time, allowing clients to react promptly to situations It&#8217;s a key &#8220;differentiator&#8221; of the company, co-founder Artem Kukharenko told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There could be systems which can process, for example, 100 cameras. When there are a lot of cameras in a city, [these systems] connect 100 cameras from one part of the city, then disconnect them and connect another hundred cameras in another part of the city, so it&#8217;s not so interesting,&#8221; he suggested.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The latest round, financed by Russia&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and an undisclosed sovereign wealth fund from the Middle East, certainly carries more strategic than financial importance. The company broke even last year with revenue reaching $8 million, three times the number from the previous year, ane expects to finish 2020 at a similar growth pace.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the new round <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">will enable the startup to develop new capabilities such as automatic detection of aggressive behavior and vehicle recognition as it seeks new customers in its key markets of the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">City contracts have a major revenue driver for the firm, but it has plans to woo non-government clients, such as those in the entertainment industry, finance, trade and hospitality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company currently boasts clients in 30 cities across 15 countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) bloc, Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe.<\/p>\n<p>These customers may procure from a variety of hardware vendors featuring different graphic processing units (GPUs) to carry out computer vision tasks. As such, NtechLab needs to ensure it&#8217;s constantly in tune with different GPU suppliers. Ten years ago, Nvidia was the go-to solution, recalled Kukharenko, but rivals such as Intel and Huawei have cropped up in recent times.<\/p>\n<p>The Moscow-based startup began life as a consumer software that allowed users to find someone&#8217;s online profile by uploading a photo of the person. It later pivoted to video and has since attracted government clients keen to deploy facial recognition in law enforcement. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian government uses NtechLab&#8217;s system to monitor large gatherings and implement access control.<\/p>\n<p>Around the world, authorities have rushed to implement similar forms of public health monitoring and tracking for virus control. While these projects are usually well-meaning, they inspire a much-needed debate around privacy, discrimination, and other consequences brought by the scramble for large-scale data solutions. NtechLab&#8217;s view is that when used properly, video surveillance generally does more good than harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you can monitor people quite [effectively], you don&#8217;t need to close all people in the city&#8230; The problem is people who don&#8217;t respect the laws. When you can monitor these people and [impose] a penalty on them, you can control the situation better,&#8221; argued Alexander Kabakov, the other co-founder of the company.<\/p>\n<p>As it expands globally, NtechLab inevitably comes across customers who misuse or abuse its algorithms. While it claimed to keep all customer data private and have no control over how its software is used, the company strives to &#8220;create a process that can be in compliance with local laws,&#8221; said Kukharenko.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We vet our partners so we can trust them, and we know that they will not use our technology for bad purposes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NtechLab, a startup that helps analyze footage captured by Moscow&#8217;s 100,000 surveillance cameras, just closed an investment of more than 1RUB billion ($13 million) to further global expansion.

It joins numerous others with 9-figure rounds in what is clearly a valuable and competitive space.<\/p>\n<p>XtalPi works with major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer that need to identify promising new drug-like molecules and learn as much about them as possible. It&#8217;s very much a race, so companies claiming to use AI to speed up the process have attracted major funding. Though there have been no prominent breakthroughs to speak of resulting from the space, it&#8217;s hard to imagine any major player can afford to ignore it.<\/p>\n<p>This company, founded in 2014, purports to offer extremely low-level simulation and prediction of target molecules, both simulating the physics at atomic levels and doing the more traditional data science work that eliminates dead ends and points towards more fruitful avenues for investigation.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Although these advances are in the digital space, the companies still need a large staff of skilled scientists who can verify and advance the results \u2014 as well as the facilities to support them.

The app was originally created as a replacement for pen and apper ledgers, but plans to introduce financial services including credit, savings and insurance. In August, the company integrated digital payments into its platform, enabling merchants to take customer payments from bank accounts and digital wallets like OVO and DANA. BukuWarung&#8217;s goal is to fill the same role for Indonesian merchants that KhataBook and OKCredit do in India.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons BukuWarung launched digital payments was in response to customer demand for contactless transactions and instant payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since introducing the feature, the company said it has already processed several million U.S. dollars in total payment volume (TPV) on an annualized basis. The company says it now serves about 1.2 million merchants across 750 locations in Indonesia, focusing on tier 2 and tier 3 cities.<\/p>\n<p>Digital payments is also the first step into building out BukuWarung\u2019s financial services, which will help differentiate it from other bookkeeping. The payments features is currently free and BukuWarung is experimenting with different monetization models, including making a small margin on fees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason why we launched payments is also very strategic, because there is a lot of pull in the market. We have already seen several millions annualized TPV in less than a month, because the payments we offer are cost-efficient as well and cheaper than to get from a bank,&#8221; Chauhan told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the Indian players, like Khatabook, they have also launched digital payments. The reason for that is because it&#8217;s a very essential step for building a business and monetization,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If you don\u2019t have payments, you can\u2019t do anything like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Chauhan added that building a financial services platform is the difference between providing a utility app that replaces bookkeeping ledgers, and becoming an essential service for merchants that will eventually include lending for working capital, savings and insurance products.

we\u2019ve altered the production process to reflect Zoom\u2019s easy onboarding and semi-casual approach to virtualized meetings and conversations.<\/p>\n<p>We now use a series of interweaved services to broadcast the live Zoom recording session over ReStream, which in turn streams to Twitter\/Periscope, YouTube and Facebook Live. Some of the show\u2019s regulars share the Facebook stream using Watch Party, aggregating comments and viewership metadata of their friends and cohorts. Once the session is over, we add music, titles, and pointers to the Gillmor Gang Telegram Backchannel, and embed the YouTube mix here on TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Much of this live-streaming strategy has been workshopped with people like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/brent-leary\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brent-leary\">Brent Leary, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> who with his CRM Playaz partner Paul Greenberg produce a growing series of live streams on LinkedIn, Facebook and other social networks. Brent joined the Gang in late 2019. On this Gillmor Gang episode, Brent switches gears from yet-another-TikToc segment to a new streaming target, Twitch. Just before he bails to co-host a Playaz show, I ask him to explain the latest project they\u2019re cooking up. Here, in his own words, is more:<\/p>\n<p>CRM Playaz Executive Roundtable Convo Livestream\u2026Not Webinar\u2026.or Panel<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing broadcast media use streaming platforms to do their jobs while they shelter in place and social distance. And while some of this has the look and feel of a Zoom conference call we\u2019re all experiencing way too much, as time goes on they also are beginning to make these live streams look like regular broadcasts to a certain extent. Which means that if they can take cues from us amateurs to do their broadcasts, we can do the same, or at least attempt to, by making our \u201cprogramming\u201d more tv-like.<\/p>\n<p>So, Paul Greenberg and I, underneath the umbrella of our CRM Playaz video podcast, had an idea. To bring senior executives from the five leading vendors in the CRM industry &#8212; according to industry market share &#8212; together for a free-flowing conversation about the state of the industry seven months into the pandemic. Kind of like what you might see on a cable news segment&#8230;but of course there\u2019s no way you\u2019d see a bunch of execs talking about CRM on CNN, Fox or MSNBC. But we\u2019re gonna do it, complete with a post-roundtable show directly following the discussion with a number of rapid-fire panels of industry analysts and thought leaders sharing their thoughts and opinions on what they heard from executive convo.<\/p>\n<p>Now we aren\u2019t talking webinar here, or something stiff and controlled like you\u2019d normally see from a traditional panel of high-level execs. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with a traditional webinar or panel. But these streaming platforms give us the ability to put a different lens on things. Maybe create an environment for a less polished but just as substantive group convo which goes wherever it needs to &#8212; and goes with humor and flexibility and twists and turns\u2026and comradery. And maybe there\u2019s an audience of folks out there in their comfortable home office taking it all in and also participating with their own commentary that might also become a part of the conversation. And those are the cues we can take from the broadcast media \u2013 to make these business live streams more comfortable, more communal and more real\u2026 and less staged and sterile.<\/p>\n<p>So we\u2019ll see how it goes on October 8th at 1:30 p.m. ET, as we are excited to bring together a group of folks who are not only leaders at the leading vendors, but also people who have personalities and senses of humor to go with all the experience and smarts. Because when you get into what will no doubt have serious interactions on important subjects, we think you can do it in a way that allows us to be human &#8212; and possibly smile at seeing a dog or cat in the background &#8212; Anne Chen of Salesforce knows what I mean. Or laugh when a little kid of one of these high-powered execs come stomping into the room looking for his mom or dad. And maybe catch a glimpse of something you just wouldn\u2019t experience in the traditional settings you\u2019d normally see a panel made up of folks like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suresh Vittal, VP Experience Cloud Platform and Products, Adobe<\/li>\n<li>Alysa Taylor, CVP Business Applications and Global Industry, Microsoft<\/li>\n<li>Rob Tarkoff, EVP\/GM of #CX, Oracle<\/li>\n<li>Bill Patterson, EVP\/GM #CRM Applications, Salesforce<\/li>\n<li>Bob Stutz, President, CX, SAP<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if you\u2019re into CRM, or just curious to see how this all comes off, you can register to join us for the live stream at <em>https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/events\/crmplayazexecutiveroundtableconversation\/<\/em> (https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/events\/crmplayazexecutiveroundtableconversation\/).

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

school networks and they&#8217;ve picked up some fresh funding led by Google&#8217;s venture arm GV.<\/p>\n<p>The team is building an old school social play focused on Gen Z high school socialization. The first iteration of their vision was a digital yearbook they rolled out earlier this year that allowed high schoolers torn from the last weeks of their school year by the COVID-19 pandemic to leave messages for friends in a virtual yearbook, replicating the act of passing around the memento over Snapchat. The team&#8217;s acronymic name &#8220;HAGS&#8221; refers to the &#8220;have a great summer&#8221; message often speedily scrawled in a classmate&#8217;s yearbook.<\/p>\n<p>The young founding team at HAGS is fully remote with CEO Suraya Shivji, 23, her younger brother Jameel, 18, and co-founder <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">James Dale, 19, building out the product. <\/span>The company says that &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tens of thousands of high school students&#8221; used the app after its initial launch. In the course of building out <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/hags-yearbook-signatures\/id1510510716\">their app<\/a>, the team caught the eye of investors over Twitter and began to roll together some early investments.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Especially when you&#8217;re investing so early, you lean on the team so much when it comes to an investment decision,&#8221; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google-ventures\">GV&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Terri Burns told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;HAGS is really early and very much in the spirit of experimentation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052685\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052685\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2052685 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png 2560w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/HAGS.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">HAGS team. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> HAGS<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The HAGS team ended up pulling together a $1 million investment led by GV <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with participation from BoxGroup and a handful of angel investors.
