vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables. It speaks to the health of the category, and I&#8217;m hopeful the industry picks up tailwinds, and we exit this dystopian period sooner than later.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

href=\"https:\/\/hopin.to\/events\/adobe-developers-live-commerce?scid=876fede8-c9f7-4367-b34b-bd33279fb182&amp;mv=social&amp;mv2=owned_social\">Adobe Developers Live<\/a> virtual conference, the company announced some new tools with a fresh emphasis on helping developers build custom apps on the Adobe Experience Cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Jason Woosley, VP of developer experience and commerce at Adobe, says that the pandemic has forced companies to build enhanced digital experiences much more quickly than they might have, and the new tools being announced today are at least partly related to helping speed up the development of better online experiences.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our focus is very specifically on making the experience-generation business something that&#8217;s very attractive to developers and very accessible to developers so we&#8217;re announcing a number of tools,&#8221; Woosley told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The idea is to build a more complete framework over time to make it easier to build applications and connect to data sources that take advantage of the Experience Cloud tooling. For starters, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.io\/apis\/experienceplatform\/project-firefly.html\">Project Firefly<\/a> is designed to help developers build applications more quickly by providing a higher level of automation than was previously available.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Fb168ua1tR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/13\/how-adobe-shifted-a-las-vegas-conference-to-executives-living-rooms-in-less-than-30-days\/\">How Adobe shifted a Las Vegas conference to executives&#8217; living rooms in less than 30 days<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Adobe shifted a Las Vegas conference to executives&#8217; living rooms in less than 30 days&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/13\/how-adobe-shifted-a-las-vegas-conference-to-executives-living-rooms-in-less-than-30-days\/embed\/#?secret=Fb168ua1tR\" data-secret=\"Fb168ua1tR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Project Firefly creates an extensibility framework that reduces the boilerplate that a developer would need to get started working with the Experience Cloud, and extends that into the customizations that we know every implementation eventually needs to differentiate the storefront experience, the website experience or whatever customer touch point as these things become increasingly digital,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make those new experiences open to all, the company is also announcing <a href=\"https:\/\/react-spectrum.adobe.com\/react-spectrum\/\">React Spectrum<\/a>, an open source set of libraries and tools designed to help members of the Adobe developer community build more accessible applications and websites.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It comes with all of the accessibility features that often get forgotten when you&#8217;re in a race to market, so it&#8217;s nice to make sure that you will be very inclusive with your design, making sure that you&#8217;re bringing on all aspects of your audiences,&#8221; Woosley said.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, a big part of interacting with Experience Cloud is taking advantage of all of the data that&#8217;s available to help build those more customized interactions with customers that having that data enables. To that end, the company is announcing some new web and mobile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.io\/apis\/experienceplatform\/mobile.html\">software development kits<\/a> (SDKs) designed to help make it simpler to link to Experience Cloud data sources as you build your applications.<\/p>\n<p>Project Firefly is available in developer preview starting today. Several React Spectrum components and some data connection SDKs are also available today. The company intends to keep adding to these various pieces in the coming months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gwn11GieEi\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/adobe-announces-a-marketers-ai-toolbox-for-experience-platform\/\">Adobe announces AI toolbox for Experience Platform<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Adobe announces AI toolbox for Experience Platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/adobe-announces-a-marketers-ai-toolbox-for-experience-platform\/embed\/#?secret=gwn11GieEi\" data-secret=\"gwn11GieEi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Adobe has had a developer program for years called Adobe.io, but today at the Adobe Developers Live virtual conference, the company announced some new tools with a fresh emphasis on helping developers build custom apps on the Adobe Experience Cloud.

how they&#8217;re approaching EU-U.S. data transfers in the wake of a landmark ruling (aka Schrems II) by Europe&#8217;s top court in July, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/\">struck down the flagship Privacy Shield over U.S. surveillance overreach<\/a>, suggests most are doing the equivalent of burying their head in the sand and hoping the legal nightmare goes away.<\/p>\n<p>European privacy rights group <a href=\"https:\/\/noyb.eu\/en\/opening-pandoras-box-companies-cant-say-how-they-comply-cjeu-ruling\">noyb<\/a> has done most of the groundwork here &#8212; rounding up in <a href=\"https:\/\/noyb.eu\/files\/web\/Replies_from_controllers_on_EU-US_transfers.pdf\">this 45-page report<\/a> responses (some in English, others in German) from EU entities of 33 companies to a set of questions about personal data transfers.<\/p>\n<p>It sums up the answers to the questions about companies&#8217; legal basis for transferring EU citizens&#8217; data over the pond post-Schrems II as &#8220;astonishing&#8221; or AWOL &#8212; given some failed to send a response at all.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tech companies polled on the issue run the alphabetic gamut from Apple to Zoom. Airbnb, Netflix and WhatsApp are among the companies that noyb says failed to respond about their EU-US data transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Responses provided by companies that did respond appear to raise many more questions than they answer &#8212; with lots of question-dodging &#8220;boilerplate responses&#8221; in evidence and\/or pointing to existing privacy policies in the hope that will make the questioner go away (hi <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook!) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also made repeat claims that sought for info falls outside the scope of the EU&#8217;s data protection framework&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052524 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png 1290w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?resize=150,20 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?resize=300,41 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?resize=768,105 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?resize=680,93 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot-2020-09-28-at-14.37.28.png?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/>In addition, noyb highlights a response by Slack which said it does not &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; provide governments with access to data &#8212; which, as the privacy rights group points out, &#8220;does not answer the question of whether they are compelled to do so under surveillance laws such as FISA702&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A similar issue affects Microsoft. So while the tech giant did at least respond specifically to each question it was asked, saying it&#8217;s relying on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU-U.S. data transfers, again it&#8217;s one of the companies subject to U.S. surveillance law &#8212; or as noyb notes: &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">explicitly named by the documents disclosed by Edward Snowden and publicly numbering the FISA702 requests by the US government it received and answered&#8221;. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">That, in turn, raises questions about how Microsoft can claim to (legally) use SCCs if users&#8217; data cannot be adequately protected from U.S. mass surveillance&#8230;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Court of Justice of the EU made it clear that use of SCCs to take data outside the EU is contingent on a case by case assessment of whether the data will in fact be safe. If it is not, the data controller is legally required to suspend the transfer. EU regulators also have a clear duty to act to suspend transfers where data is at risk.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, we were astonished by how many companies were unable to provide little more than a boilerplate answer. It seems that most of the industry still does not have a plan as to how to move forward,&#8221; noyb adds.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/18\/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints\/\">August<\/a> the group filed 101 complaints against websites it had identified as still sending data to the U.S. via Google Analytics and\/or Facebook Connect integrations &#8212; with, again, both tech giants clearly subject to U.S. surveillance laws, such as FISA 702.<\/p>\n<p>And noyb founder Max Schrems &#8212; whose surname has become synonymous with questions over EU-U.S. data transfers &#8212; continues to push the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) to take enforcement action over Facebook&#8217;s use of SCCs in a case that dates back some seven years.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling\/\">Earlier this month<\/a> it emerged the DPC had written to Facebook &#8212; issuing a preliminary order to suspend transfers. However Facebook filed an appeal for a judicial review in the Irish courts and was granted a stay.<\/p>\n<p>In an affidavit filed to the court, the tech giant appeared to claim it could shut down its service in Europe if the suspension order is enforced. But <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban\/\">last week<\/a> Facebook&#8217;s global VP and former U.K. deputy PM, Nick Clegg, denied it could shut down in Europe over the issue. Though, he warned of \u201cprofound effects\u201d on scores of digital businesses if a way is not found by lawmakers on both sides of the pond to resolve the legal uncertainty around U.S. data transfers. (A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/eu-us-privacy-shield-is-dead-long-live-privacy-shield\/\">Privacy Shield 2<\/a> has been mooted but the European Commission has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec\/\">warned there&#8217;s no quick fix<\/a>, suggesting reform of U.S. surveillance law will be required.)<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Schrems <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two\/\">has suggested<\/a> the solution for Facebook at least is to federate its service &#8212; splitting its infrastructure in two. But Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/breton-wants-tiktok-data-to-stay-in-europe\/\">also called for<\/a> &#8220;European data&#8230;[to] be stored and processed in Europe&#8221; &#8212; arguing earlier this month this data &#8220;belong in Europe&#8221; and &#8220;there is nothing protectionist about this&#8221;, in a discussion that flowed from U.S. President Trump&#8217;s concerns about TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Back in Ireland, Facebook has complained to the courts that regulatory action over its EU-EU data transfers is being rushed (despite the complaint dating back to 2013); and also that it&#8217;s being unfairly singled out.<\/p>\n<p>But now with data transfer complaints filed by noyb against scores of companies on the desk of every EU data supervisor, and regulators under explicit ECJ instruction, they have a duty to step in, as a lot of pressure is being exerted to actually enforce the law and uphold Europeans&#8217; data rights.<\/p>\n<p>The European Data Protection Board&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/24\/no-grace-period-after-schrems-ii-privacy-shield-ruling-warn-eu-data-watchdogs\/\">guidance<\/a> on Schrems II &#8212; which Facebook had also claimed to be waiting for &#8212; also specifies that the ability<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> to (legally) use SCCs to transfer data to the U.S. hinges on a data controller being able to offer a legal guarantee that \u201cU.S. law does not impinge on the adequate level of protection\u201d for the transferred data. So Facebook et al would do well to lobby the U.S. government on reform of FISA.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PR6wM7uute\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling\/\">Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

which, for the first time, adds Dolby Vision support as well as Bluetooth. The company is also introducing a combination player and soundbar device, called the Roku Streambar. And the Roku OS software update will bring a handful of new features to customers, including, most notably, Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support.<\/p>\n<p>On the hardware front, Roku continues its strategy of refreshing devices and plugging other holes in the market with the launch of the two new players.<\/p>\n<p>With the revamp of the Roku Ultra, the company promises up to 50% more wireless range and the addition of Bluetooth support. The expanded range will allow customers to use their Ultra even farther away from the internet router without compromising their streaming quality and experience. Meanwhile, the addition of Bluetooth means you&#8217;ll be able to pair your smartphone with the device in order to stream music or other audio through the Roku Ultra to the TV.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052236\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052236\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052236\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Ultra-with-Remote.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The updated Roku Ultra adds Dolby Vision support along with Dolby Atmos sound, to cater to customers who have Dolby Vision TVs.

On the player side, the egg carton-sized device is the equivalent of the Roku Streaming Stick+ and works with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The soundbar attaches to the TV via an HDMI cable, and if the TV offers ARC support that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ll need to get started. Otherwise, you can use the included optical cable that comes in the box.<\/p>\n<p>The soundbar has four premium drivers, including two forward-facing drivers to bring out the dialogue and center channel and two on the side, angled to help fill the room with sound. The device will also support Roku features, like the ability to quiet loud commercials, boost the volume of voices, or optimize the sound for night listening.<\/p>\n<p>The device also supports Bluetooth, Spotify Connect, Alexa and Google Assistant, and a voice remote that controls the TV, sound and streaming.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052242\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052242\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052242\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png 7680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Roku-Audio-Family.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While the soundbar is largely being pitched as an entry-level device for newcomers to Roku or an all-in-one solution for use with a new TV, it still allows a customer to expand their home theater setup over time.

During its negotiations with NBCU, for example, a dispute led to NBCU threatening to pull its TV Everywhere apps off Roku before <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/peacock-roku\/\">the two sides worked things out<\/a>. Today, HBO Max, another major new streaming app, is still not available on Roku. Customers are the ones who really lose in these sorts of battles, of course, so the AirPlay 2 support will be a decent workaround for those times when apps are not available.<\/p>\n<p>Roku OS 9.4 will also bring HomeKit support to select 4K devices so customers can control their Roku via the Home app and Siri on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch or HomePod.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052272\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052272\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052272\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=300,253 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=768,648 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=680,574 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/The-Roku-Channel-mobile-app-darker-background.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052272\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The update will also bring a new &#8220;Live TV&#8221; tile to the home screen, featuring a live guide to The Roku Channel&#8217;s over 115 free live channels.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/klaxoon-teases-new-interactive-meeting-product-for-video-calls\/\">teasing<\/a> its new product, French startup <a href=\"https:\/\/klaxoon.com\">Klaxoon<\/a> is launching Board, a visual interface that lets you work together during a video call. Instead of staring at other people\u2019s faces, you get a shared canvas that you can use for presentations and to suggest ideas.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/klaxoon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"klaxoon\">Klaxoon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is well aware that many companies have strong opinions about video conferencing services. Some companies are already using Microsoft Teams for everything, others are using Zoom or Google Meet. That\u2019s why the company is trying to make it as easy as possible to use Board while you\u2019re on a call using Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Google Meet.<\/p>\n<p>Given that you\u2019re already in Board when you\u2019re generating a Zoom link, you can also use Klaxoon\u2019s own video-conferencing service called Live.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cVideo represents less than 10% of your screen real estate. Our goal isn\u2019t to compete with other services when it comes to pixels, high definition or the number of thumbnails,\u201d Klaxoon co-founder and CEO Matthieu Beucher told me.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, when you use Live, you accept multiple constraints that could help you remain focused on your meeting. For instance, you can only have 15 people in your meeting. The person organizing the meeting can set a limit \u2014 it can be five minutes, 15 minutes or 30 minutes. But you can\u2019t use Live for a meeting that lasts longer than 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, other people on the calls are represented through tiny thumbnails on the right side of the screen. Most of the screen is filled with a sort of digital whiteboard that you can use to write text, insert images or videos. You can work on your board before starting the meeting or you can add a table from a template library.<\/p>\n<p>People joining your meeting can submit ideas through digital sticky notes. You can also switch from the freeform view to a more structured column view to move ideas from one category to another.<\/p>\n<p>Klaxoon has been working on interactive whiteboards and meeting tools for quite a few years now. Board combines some of the stuff that the company is already providing to its clients, but with a focus on remote meetings. The service is launching today for \u20ac9.90 per month.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051587\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051587\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2051587\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Klaxoon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few weeks after teasing its new product, French startup Klaxoon is launching Board, a visual interface that lets you work together during a video call.

Devices &#8212; on Tuesday, October 13 (midnight PT) and carrying on through Wednesday, October 14, just weeks ahead of Black Friday. Prime Day will take place in the U.S., U.K., U.A.E, Spain, Singapore, Netherlands, Mexico, Luxembourg, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium, Austria, Australia and (for the first time) Turkey and Brazil.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Prime Day, as its name implies, is a sale aimed at people who are members of Amazon&#8217;s Prime loyalty <\/span>program, which provides free shipping on a big range of items, access to Amazon&#8217;s various streamed media services, and other perks, for a monthly or annual fee. There are some\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/press.aboutamazon.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-sales-21-874-billion\">150 million+ people<\/a> globally who now take out Prime memberships and Amazon offers <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/primeday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free trials<\/a> for people to sign up so that they can buy during the two-day event.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>(Pricing for Prime starts at\u00a0$119 a year or $12.99 a month for individuals, with discounts for students, those on government assistance and others. Business Prime for businesses starts at $69 per year.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The event, which is still called &#8220;Prime Day&#8221; even though it has grown over time to 48 hours, is usually held over the summer as a way of boosting buying activity in what can otherwise be more sluggish shopping months &#8212; 2019&#8217;s event was in July &#8212; but this year, it was postponed because of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>That was likely due to multiple reasons. Given that the virus was peaking in the U.S. this summer, having a big sales event might have been a bad look. But in addition to that, the economic impact of the virus has also taken a toll: for many budgets have tightened, and so if consumers are going to take the time to buy big-ticket items, Amazon is possibly banking on them doing that only once this year, during holiday shopping, rather than twice.<\/p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Prime Day stacks up in that context. Last year, Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/17\/amazon-sells-over-175m-items-during-prime-day-2019-more-than-black-friday-cyber-monday-combined\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said<\/a> that its Prime Day (which was extended for the first time to 48 hours in 2019) sold 175 million items, more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.<\/p>\n<p>Those are the key dates to note. Thanksgiving weekend &#8212; bookended by the U.S. holiday and Cyber Monday and including Black Friday &#8212; have over the years become the unofficial &#8220;start&#8221; of the holiday shopping season. That period has become <em>the<\/em> key moment for retailers offline and online, when they bank on doing the most selling of the year and hitting (or hopefully passing) their numbers.<\/p>\n<p>By placing its Prime Day event just a month ahead of that period, Amazon is essentially extending out the start time of that period, experimenting with the idea that they might actually get to &#8220;own&#8221; the whole start to the shopping season.<\/p>\n<p>That may sound bold, but Amazon&#8217;s impact on wider shopping patterns and &#8220;shopping holidays&#8221; had\u00a0already been proven. Last year, some <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/27\/250-retailers-will-compete-against-amazons-prime-day-up-from-194-last-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">250 other online retailers, competitors to Amazon, set up promotional events to coincide with Prime Day<\/a>, taking advantage of people being online and ready to buy things, and trying to make sure they are not cut out of the spending sprees.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it&#8217;s not a sure thing, in the current climate. Even though Amazon, like a lot of other online retailers, has been raking in the sales as more people have turned away from physical stores to comply with social distancing rules, the longer-term picture has been less sure. The job market is not strong, and people are watching their wallets.<\/p>\n<p>So Amazon is taking all that on board and trying to pin bigger sweeteners into the mix on both sides of its marketplace. In addition to offering free trials of Prime (which it always does) it said it will give $10 credits to people to use on Prime Day if they spend $10 with selected small businesses between now and October 12.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the midst of an unprecedented year, we\u2019re committed to making this the most successful Prime Day ever for our small businesses and excited for Prime members worldwide to discover new ways to support local entrepreneurs and save big on everything they need and love,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, Amazon CEO Worldwide Consumer, in a statement. \u201cThis year\u2019s Prime Day is the perfect opportunity for Prime members to get their holiday shopping done early from the comfort of their homes \u2013 and to have more time to spend with their families and friends throughout the season.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Although Amazon sells a giant amount of merchandise directly, its network of third-party sellers, many of which are small businesses that have come to rely on Amazon as <\/span>the<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0central piece of their e-commerce strategies, is a critical part of its wider catalogue, so getting them on board has been a major effort for the company. (Not least because it helps the company in its general antitrust profile, too.) <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u201cIn such an unsettled economy, we\u2019ve actually been able to grow our sales with Amazon, allowing us to pay our employees more and pivot quickly when supply chain shortages struck,\u201d said Colleen Sundlie, owner of Date Lady in Springfield, Missouri, in a statement. \u201cSelling online has helped us stay connected with customers and continue growing our small business despite the challenging times.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Playing with Holiday Shopping dates is really par for the course for Amazon, which also said that it&#8217;s getting a jump on its own Prime Day with sales starting today on Amazon Devices like the Echo Dot (get<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> one for $39.98) and Fire TV Recast ($129.99), and $100 off on Fire TV Edition Smart TVs, as well as deals on its streaming and media services, for example subscribing to four months of <\/span>Amazon Music for $0.99.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also pushing its payments services for the event.

However, last <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/25\/uber-has-again-been-denied-licence-renewal-in-london-over-safety-risks\/\">November<\/a> the regulator once again denied a full licence renewal &#8212; raising a range of new safety issues.<\/p>\n<p>Despite that, Uber has been able to continue operating in London throughout the appeals process &#8212; albeit, with ongoing uncertainty over the future of its licence. Now it will be hoping this is in the past.<\/p>\n<p>In the appeal, Uber&#8217;s key argument was that it is now &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; to hold a licence &#8212; claiming it has listened to the regulator&#8217;s concerns and learnt from errors, making major changes to address issues related to passenger safety.<\/p>\n<p>For example Uber pointed to improvements in its governance and document review systems, including a freeze on drivers who had not taken a trip for an extended period; real-time driver ID verification; and new scrutiny teams and processes; as well as the launch of &#8220;Programme Zero&#8221; &#8212; which aims to prevent all breaches of licence conditions.<\/p>\n<p>It also argued system flaws were not widespread &#8212; claiming only 24 of the 45,000 drivers using the app had exploited its system, to its knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>It also argued it now cooperates effectively and proactively with TfL and police forces, denying it conceals any failures. Furthermore, it claimed denying its licence would have a &#8220;profound effect&#8221; on groups at risk of street harassment &#8212; such as women and ethnic minorities, as well as disabled people.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s certainly fair to say the Uber of 2020 has travelled some distance from the company whose toxic internal culture included developing proprietary software to try to thwart regulatory oversight and eventually led to a major change of guard of its senior management.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s interesting the court took the step of considering what length of licence Uber should receive &#8212; so while it&#8217;s a win for Uber, there are still some watchful caveats.<\/p>\n<p>Offering commentary on today&#8217;s ruling, Anna McCaffrey, a senior counsel for the law firm Taylor Wessing, highlighted this element of the judgement. &#8220;The Magistrates Court agreed that Uber had made improvements and addressed TfL safety concerns. However, the fact that the length of extension is up for debate, rather than securing Uber&#8217;s preferred five year licence, demonstrates that Uber will have to work hard to continue to prove to TfL and the Court that it has really changed. If not, Uber is likely to find itself back in Court facing the same battle next year,&#8221; she noted in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>She also pointed out that a decision is still pending from the Supreme Court to &#8220;finally settle&#8221; the question as to whether Uber&#8217;s drivers are workers or self-employed &#8212; another <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/10\/uber-loses-uk-tribunal-appeal-over-driver-employment-rights\/\">long-running legal saga<\/a> for Uber in the U.K.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also now facing <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/20\/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court\/\">fresh legal challenges related to its algorithmic management of drivers<\/a>. So there&#8217;s still plenty of work for its lawyers.<\/p>\n<p>The App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU), meanwhile, offered a cautious welcome of the court&#8217;s decision to grant Uber&#8217;s licence renewal &#8212; given how many of its members are picking up jobs via its platform.<\/p>\n<p>However, the union also called for the mayor of London to break up what it dubbed Uber&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly&#8221; by imposing limits on the numbers of drivers who can register on its platform. In a statement, ADCU president Yaseen Aslam argued: \u201cThe reduced scale will give both Uber and Transport for London the breathing space necessary to ensure all compliance obligations &#8212; including worker rights &#8212; are met in future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 1:<\/strong> Uber has now sent this statement &#8212; attributed to <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern &amp; Eastern Europe: &#8220;<\/span>This decision is a recognition of Uber\u2019s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL. There is nothing more important than the safety of the people who use the Uber app as we work together to keep London moving.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 2: <\/strong>TfL has also sent a response. A spokesperson told us: \u201cWe note the Court has found that Uber is now fit and proper to hold a private hire operator\u2019s licence in London. As a result of our decision in November last year Uber has implemented a number of changes to improve passenger safety and address the issues we identified.

Now, nearly a year later, the company confirmed to TechCrunch during conversations surrounding its new capital raise that it\u2019s keeping its focus for now. <\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linking the carriers and platforms of other insurance verticals, or varietals, will have to wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Noyo is working in an enormous market, namely the U.S. health insurance universe, one that could provide it with space to grow for years to come. The startup sells the use of its application programming interfaces, or APIs, which in Noyo\u2019s case allow customers to &#8220;execute, track, and confirm the fulfillment of member transaction requests to carriers,&#8221; citing the startup&#8217;s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.noyoconnect.com\/#noyo-fulfillment-api\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">documentation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company&#8217;s product was born out of frustration that Noyo co-founders Shannon Goggin and Dennis Lee dealt with while working for Zenefits, an HR tech unicorn that ran into problems with regulators and customers alike. For more on that story, our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/noyo-wants-to-become-the-api-layer-for-health-insurance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prior reporting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is useful. (Notably, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/agentsync.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AgentSync<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another API startup play <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/04\/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under construction by Zenefits alums<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The American healthcare market is enormous, lucrative and fraught with inefficiencies and antiquated technology. And the insurance portion of the healthcare market is similarly titanic and broken, providing an outsize opportunity for a startup that can navigate its politics and unique needs with a technology solution able to help incumbents speed up, and save money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Series A<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noyo&#8217;s new funding event was led by Costanoa Ventures and Spark Capital. Prior investors Core Innovation Capital, Garuda Ventures, the Webb Investment Network, Precursor Ventures and Homebrew upped their investment in the new round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homebrew&#8217;s Satya Patel was effusive about the company in a comment provided to TechCrunch, saying that Noyo&#8217;s &#8220;technology and strategic vision have convinced major industry leaders to get on board right out of the gate.&#8221; This tracks with what the company has said, including that it has lined up new partnerships with insurance providers Ameritas and Humana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patel also noted that \u201cNoyo is helping connect insurance companies and the growing ecosystem of insurtechs,\u201d a portion of the startup market that TechCrunch has worked to track in the last year as it has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/02\/why-vcs-are-dumping-money-into-insurance-marketplaces\/\">raised piles of capital<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/02\/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public\/\">seen notable liquidity<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/as-tech-stocks-dip-is-insurtech-startup-root-targeting-an-ipo\/\">continues to drive headlines more recently<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good question to ask startups that don\u2019t run their cash accounts near zero before raising new funds is why they raised <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In Noyo\u2019s case, I was curious what was the catalyzing factor for it to go out and raise more capital.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goggin said that Noyo had found \u201creally good signal and pickup from our early clients and partners.\u201d That, combined with what she described as a \u201cvery clear sense of what we needed to do, and how we could accelerate bringing our future vision to life\u201d were enough for her team to say \u201calright, let\u2019s settle down, this is working, let\u2019s be able to take the big swings.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And thus the Series A came together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noyo has plans to keep hiring, with Goggin telling TechCrunch that her company is currently around 20 people, but will be around 30 by the time 2021 kicks off. She added that \u201cthe nice thing\u201d about her new capital raise is that her startup won\u2019t have \u201ca staffing constraint\u201d when it wants to \u201croll out a new product.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pace at which Noyo builds, then, should accelerate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which, in turn, should yield more revenue growth. Goggin cautioned that Noyo is not aiming for profitability but is, at the same time, \u201ca real business with a viable model.\u201d The Series A stage is generally a bit early to press founders on growth metrics, as most won&#8217;t share unless they are outlier-good. But happily, by the time that Noyo raises a Series B, it should have enough revenue history for some useful year-over-year comparisons, and we will ask for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Noyo round is another data point that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/22\/api-startups-are-so-hot-right-now\/\">API-delivered startups are seeing good market traction<\/a>, and that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/10\/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020\/\">investors are taking notice<\/a>.

which offers an online payments API for businesses in the Philippines, was the first Filipino-owned financial tech startup to take part in Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program. Y Combinator and Global Founders Capital, another previous investor, both returned for the Series A, which also included participation from new backer Bedrock Capital.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo partners with financial institutions, and its products include a payments API that can be integrated into websites and apps, allowing them to accept payments from bank cards and digital wallets like GrabPay and GCash. For social commerce sellers and other people who sell mostly through messaging apps, the startup offers PayMongo Links, which buyers can click on to send money. PayMongo\u2019s platform also includes features like a fraud and risk detection system.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a statement, Stripe\u2019s APAC business lead Noah Pepper said it invested in PayMongo because &#8220;we\u2019ve been impressed with the PayMongo team and the speed at which they\u2019ve made digital payments more accessible to so many businesses across the Philippines.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/25\/manila-based-payments-processing-startup-paymongo-raises-2-7-million-in-seed-funding\/\">launched in June 2019 with $2.7 million in seed funding<\/a>, which the founders said was one of the largest seed rounds ever raised by a Philippines-based fintech startup. PayMongo has now raised a total of almost $15 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>Co-founder and chief executive Francis Plaza said PayMongo has processed a total of almost $20 million in payments since launching, and grown at an average of 60% since the start of the year, with a surge after lockdowns began in March.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the company originally planned to start raising its Series A in the first half of next year, but the growth in demand for its services during COVID-19 prompted it to start the round earlier so it could hire for its product, design and engineering teams and speed up the release of new features. These will include more online payment options; features for invoicing and marketplaces; support for business models like subscriptions; and faster payout cycles.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo also plans to add more partnerships with financial service providers, improve its fraud and risk detection systems and secure more licenses from the central bank so it can start working on other types of financial products.<\/p>\n<p>The startup is among fintech companies in Southeast Asia that have seen accelerated growth as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/week-asia\/economics\/article\/3088351\/coronavirus-drives-southeast-asia-digitalisation-push-raising\">the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many businesses<\/a> to digitize more of their operations. Plaza said that overall digital transactions in the Philippines grew 42% between January and April because of the country\u2019s lockdowns.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo is currently the only payments company in the Philippines with an onboarding process that was developed to be completely online, he added, which makes it attractive to merchants that are accepting online payments for the first time. &#8220;We have a more efficient review of compliance requirements for the expeditious approval of applications so that our merchants can use our platform right away and we make sure we have a fast payout to our merchants,&#8221; said Plaza.<\/p>\n<p>If the momentum continues even as lockdowns are lifted in different cities, that means the Philippine\u2019s central bank is on track to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketresearchphilippines.com\/insight\/the-philippines-e-payment-target-gets-promoted-during-quarantine\">reach its goal of increasing the volume of e-payment transactions to 20% of total transactions<\/a> in the country this year. The government <a href=\"https:\/\/unctad.org\/en\/pages\/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2409\">began setting policies in 2015 to encourage more online payments<\/a> in a bid to bolster economic growth and financial inclusion, since smartphone penetration in the Philippines is high, but many people don\u2019t have a traditional bank account, which often charge high fees.<\/p>\n<p>Though lockdown restrictions in the Philippines have eased, Plaza said PayMongo is still seeing strong traction. &#8220;We believe the digital shift by Filipino businesses will continue, largely because both merchants and customers continue to practice safety measures such as staying at home and choosing online shopping despite the more lenient quarantine levels. Online will be the new normal for commerce.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stripe has led a $12 million Series A round in Manila-based online payment platform PayMongo, the startup announced today.

legality and whether the app poses a risk to national security, as the Trump administration claims.<\/p>\n<p>For weeks since President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in early August, the government has threatened to shut down the viral video sharing app over fears that its parent company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> headquartered in Beijing, could be forced to turn over user data to the Chinese government. TikTok, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/tiktok-hits-100m-users-in-europe-as-the-clock-ticks-on-its-us-business\/\">100 million users<\/a>\u00a0in the United States alone, has long rejected the claims.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok first filed a lawsuit against the administration on September 18, and on Thursday this week filed a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban\/\">last-minute injunction<\/a> in an effort to stop the ban going into effect Sunday night. On Friday, the government asked the court to reject the injunction in a sealed motion, which the government later refiled as a public motion with some redactions. A public hearing on the injunction was set for Sunday morning. The case is being heard in DC District Court, by judge Carl J. Nichols presiding.<\/p>\n<p>In its ruling on Sunday, the court gave just its decision, with the formal opinion handed over privately to just the two opposing parties. Due to sensitive material included in the government&#8217;s motion, the parties have until Monday to ask for any redactions before the final opinion will be published.<\/p>\n<p>The decision is just the latest episode in the continuing saga of the sprawling fight over the future of the fastest-growing social app in America. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/13\/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok\/\">deal reached<\/a> between ByteDance and the U.S. government last weekend was believed to have resolved the standoff between the two parties, but the deal has frayed over disputed details\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">between buyer Oracle<\/a> and ByteDance.<\/p>\n<p>The administration first launched an action against TikTok on August 6, with President Trump arguing in an executive order that the app posed an unreasonable national security risk for American citizens. That order mirrored a similar one published the same day that put restrictions on the popular Mandarin-language messenger app WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, a federal magistrate judge in San Francisco put in place an injunction on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">the Commerce Department\u2019s ban on WeChat<\/a>, pending further court deliberations. TikTok, whose arguments mirror those in the WeChat lawsuit, was hoping for a similar outcome in its own legal proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>One difference between the two lawsuits is the plaintiffs. In WeChat\u2019s case, a group of WeChat users filed a lawsuit arguing that a ban would hurt their expression of speech. TikTok is representing itself in its own fight with the government.<\/p>\n<p>The court case is TikTok Inc. et al v.

But parts of the website still load without needing to log in, including its dashboard and the &#8220;standard&#8221; request form used by law enforcement to request customer data.<\/p>\n<p>The portal provides a rare glimpse into how Amazon handles law enforcement requests.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2052361\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1064\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg 1928w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=144,150 144w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=289,300 289w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=768,798 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=654,680 654w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=1478,1536 1478w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-1.jpg?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2052362\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1119\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg 1928w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=137,150 137w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=275,300 275w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=768,839 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=622,680 622w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=1406,1536 1406w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=1874,2048 1874w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amazon-police-request-2.jpg?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This form allows law enforcement to request customer data using a wide variety of data points, including Amazon order numbers, serial numbers of Amazon Echo and Fire devices, credit card details and bank account numbers, gift cards, delivery and shipping numbers, and even the Social Security number of delivery drivers.<\/p>\n<p>It also allows law enforcement to obtain records related to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon-web-services\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon-web-services\">Amazon Web Services <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> accounts by submitting domain names or IP addresses related to the request.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming this was a bug, we sent Amazon several emails prior to publication but did not hear back.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is not the only tech company with a portal for law enforcement requests.

Here&#8217;s what one founder told him:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many [companies] are considering manufacturing in areas like Southeast Asia and India. Vietnam, in particular, has offered an appealing proposition for a labor pool, notes Ho Chi Minh City-based Sonny Vu,\u00a0CEO of carbon-fiber products manufacturer Arevo and founder of deep tech VC fund Alabaster. \u201cWe\u2019re friendly [with] the Americans and the West in general. Vietnam, they\u2019ve got 100 million people, they can make stuff,\u201d Vu explains. \u201cThe supply chains are getting more and more sophisticated. One of the issues has been the subpar supply chain \u2026 it\u2019s not as deep and broad as as other places like China. That\u2019s changing really fast and people are willing to do manufacturing. I\u2019ve heard from my friends trying to make stuff in China, labor\u2019s always this chronic issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Danny Crichton <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation\/\">blamed nationalistic US policies<\/a> for undermining the country&#8217;s long-term commitment to leading global free trade and threatening its competitive future, in a provocative rant last weekend. There&#8217;s truth to that, but the underlying truth is that globalization worked, it just hasn&#8217;t work as well as hoped for a lot of people in the US and some other parts of the world. In addition to phenomenon like China&#8217;s industrial engine, for example, those cross-border flows of money and technology have helped nurture the startup ecosystem in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Mike Butcher, who has been covering startups for TechCrunch from London since last decade, writes about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/new-research-shows-european-startups-are-spending-drastically-less-on-a-us-launch-for-the-same-gains\/\">a new report from Index Ventures about this trend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It used to be the case that in order to scale globally, European companies needed to spend big on launching in the U.S. to achieve the kind of growth they wanted. That usually meant relocating large swathes of the team to the San Francisco Bay Area, or New York. New research suggests that is no longer the case, as the U.S. has become more expensive, and as the opportunity in Europe has improved. This means European startups are committing much less of their team and resources to a U.S. launch, but still getting decent results&#8230;. Between 2008-2014, almost two-thirds (59%) of European startups expanded, or moved entirely, to the U.S. ahead of Series A funding rounds. However, between 2015-2019, this number decreased to a third (33%).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The report also highlights the economic problem of dividing up markets into political blocks. &#8220;European corporates invest three-quarters (76%) less than their U.S. counterparts on software,&#8221; Butcher adds about the report. &#8220;And this is normally on compliance rather than innovation. This means European startups are likely to continue to look to the U.S. for exits to corporates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The pain from failing to trade will come home sooner or later to each government, as Danny observes. But that could be longer than your current company exists. Instead, now is the time to pick the markets you can win, and plan for a world where success has a lower ceiling. And hey, if you&#8217;re lucky, your national government could pick you as its winner!<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052333\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052333\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2052333\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1103\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=279,300 279w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=768,827 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=631,680 631w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/VineetJain.jpg?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052333\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/egnyte.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egnyte <\/a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/egnyte.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(opens in a new window)<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Want $100m ARR? Fix your churn<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been recapping key moments from the Extra Crunch Stage at Disrupt this week, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/scaling-to-100-million-arr-3-founders-share-their-insights\/\">a key segment from a panel Alex Wilhelm hosted<\/a> about how to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/10\/the-100m-arr-club\/\">achieve the $100m ARR dream<\/a>, featuring Egnyte CEO Vineet Jain:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>After explaining that in the early stages of building a SaaS company it\u2019s common to focus more on adding new revenue than \u201cplugging the holes at the bottom,\u201d [Jain] added that as a company matures and grows, more focus has to be paid to managing churn and retention. He said that dollar-based retention is a key metric in the SaaS world that startups are valued by, meaning that after securing a customer, your ability to upsell that same account over a \u201cdefined window of time\u201d really matters.<\/p>\n<p>Noting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that bonuses at Egnyte are tied to retention, \u201cI say, managing churn is the new revenue,\u201d he added. \u201cFocus on that disproportionately more than you would focus on just top-line growth\u201d &#8230; . Egnyte, Jain added, drives to just one or two metrics (net new MRR, or gross MRR adds and churn). \u201cEverything that we\u2019re doing, all of us [at Egnyte] have to be measured with that number to say, \u2018How are we doing as a company?\u2019\u201d So if your startup is post-Series A, listen to what Jain says on managing churn. After all his company reached $100 million ARR, has a few dozen million in the bank,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.egnyte.com\/press-releases\/egnyte-announces-double-digit-revenue-momentum-year-over-year\">grew 22% in Q2<\/a> and is EBITDA positive.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1996011\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1996011\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1996011\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1996011\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nigelsussman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nigel Sussman <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Summer of tech IPOs continues with Root, Corsair Gaming and of course, Palantir<\/h2>\n<p>While public markets have waffled on tech stocks lately, the overall momentum of unicorn IPOs has continued.<\/p>\n<p>Except, Danny may have slowed things down a bit for Palantir?

Apps can now be stored off screen in the new App Library where they&#8217;re organized for you, as opposed to you being forced to categorize apps yourself into various folders. And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> finally allows for home screen widgets &#8212; a development that left Android users snickering about how &#8220;behind&#8221; their iPhone-using counterparts have been all this time.<\/p>\n<p>But as with iOS apps, Apple&#8217;s design constraints and rules around widgets mean there&#8217;s a standard that all widgets have to meet to be approved. As a result, widgets have a consistent look-and-feel, thanks to things like size limitations and other design guidelines. They can&#8217;t be stretched out indefinitely or moved all over the screen, either.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may have originally envisioned widgets as a way for existing iOS apps to gain a larger presence on users&#8217; home screens, while delivering key information like news, weather or stock updates, for example. But<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/creating-your-own-widgets-a-new-category-of-apps-emerges\/\"> a handful of iOS developers<\/a> instead built apps that allowed users to design widgets themselves &#8212; by selecting colors, fonts, sizes, backgrounds and what information the widget would display.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TikTok users and other Gen Z&#8217;ers began teaching each other how to create custom icons for their apps using Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app. These tutorials were starting to trend even before iOS 14&#8217;s release, but the addition of the App Library and widgets meant users could now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization\/\">finally customize their entire home screen<\/a>. That prompted a more enthusiastic adoption of the icon customization technique.<\/p>\n<p>On the Twitter hashtag #iOS14homescreen, users shared their creations &#8212; a showcase of creativity where home screens looked fully themed at last, with custom icons, widgets, decorative photos, matching wallpapers and more. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1308127358038179843?s=20\">The results have been fantastic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And at the top of the App Store, there now sit a trio of must-have tools for this new era: Widgetsmith, Color Widgets and Photo Widget today continue to claim the top three spots on the free apps chart.<\/p>\n<p>Users are also now demanding Apple to change how app shortcuts open. Currently, an app shortcut first launches Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts app, which then opens the target app. With the popularity of custom icons, users want that intermediate step cut out.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is aware of the customization craze as it has in the days since iOS 14&#8217;s release run App Store editorial features about iOS 14&#8217;s design changes, suggested widgets to try, creative tools and more. It also featured apps at the top of the App Store, which are benefiting from the trend, like apps offering great widgets, like Fantastical, or those that are booming, like Pinterest &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/22\/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas\/\">recently broke<\/a> its daily download record.<\/p>\n<h2>App makers team up to take on Apple and Google<\/h2>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A number of top app makers have banded together to fight against\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple\u2019s <\/a>control of its App Store and, to a lesser extent, Google\u2019s control of the Play Store \u2014 a topic of increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Today, 13 app publishers, including Epic Games, Deezer, Basecamp, Tile, Spotify and others, have launched the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">Coalition for App Fairness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new organization formalizes efforts the companies already have underway that focus on either forcing app store providers to change their policies, or ultimately pushing the app stores into regulation.<\/p>\n<p>On the coalition\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/appfairness.org\/\">website<\/a>, the group details its key issues, which include anti-competitive practices, like the app stores\u2019 30% commission structure, and the inability to distribute software to billions of Apple devices through any other means but the App Store, which the group sees as an affront to personal freedom.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> allows apps to be side-loaded, so it\u2019s not as much of a target on this front. In fact, much of the focus of the coalition\u2019s efforts have to do with Apple\u2019s business, given its stricter guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>The group has also published a list of 10 \u201cApp Store Principles\u201d it would like to see enacted industry-wide. These include the ability to distribute apps outside of app stores, protections from having their own data used against them to compete, timely access to developer documentation, the right to communicate with users through its app for legitimate business purposes, no requirements to use the app store\u2019s payment systems, no requirements to pay unfair fees and more.<\/p>\n<p>The website is also aiming to recruit new members to join the coalition. App makers who feel similarly oppressed by Apple\u2019s practices are able to fill out a form to request to join.<\/p>\n<p>Apple responded to the hardball tactics with a barrage of new material and data meant to highlight the benefits of its App Store platform. The company on Thursday <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/app-store-rejected-150000-apps-in-2020-is-seeing-100000-submissions-per-week\">revealed the number<\/a> of rejections it enforces is quite low compared to the number of submissions. It said it rejected 150,000 apps in 2020 but sees 100,000 submissions per week. It also has removed more than 60 million user reviews it believed to be spam.<\/p>\n<p>The company noted its Developer program has over 28 million developers worldwide, whose apps have seen over 50 billion promotions &#8212; meaning when a user sees an app Apple has promoted on the App Store, in emails, on social media or in other general advertising.<\/p>\n<p>However, the backlash has also <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/09\/24\/apple-clarifies-details-on-video-partner-program-for-developers\">forced Apple to be more transparent<\/a> about some of its until-now fairly secretive programs. For example, Apple has <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/video-partner\/\">now published a page<\/a> that clarifies how its Video Partner program works &#8212; a program that had before only been detailed via background conversations with reporters who then relayed the information to readers. The page reveals the program&#8217;s requirements and that over 130 premium subscription video entertainment providers have since joined. If the guidelines are followed, these providers can pay only a 15% commission to Apple instead of 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Current members include Amazon Prime Video, Binge, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Claro, C More, DAZN, Disney+, Globo, HBO Max, Joyn, Molotov, MUBI, myCanal, STARZ and Viaplay, the website said.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok deal chaos continues<\/h2>\n<p>No, seriously, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">what is going on<\/a> with the TikTok deal?

The move came shortly after WeChat users <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">were granted<\/a> an injunction in a federal court last week that blocked the app from being banned.
