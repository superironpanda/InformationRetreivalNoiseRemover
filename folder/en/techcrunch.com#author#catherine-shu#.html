vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables. It speaks to the health of the category, and I&#8217;m hopeful the industry picks up tailwinds, and we exit this dystopian period sooner than later.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience.

They include Taipei-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kkday.com\/en\">KKday<\/a>, which announced today that it has closed a $75 million Series C led by Cool Japan Fund and the National Development Fund of Taiwan.

The latter is especially important during the pandemic because many venues have set up capacity limits.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company says that Rezio has served over 150,000 customers so far, and will be launched in more Asian markets with its Series C funding. KKDay currently has more than five million users on its platform, and has hosted more than 30,000 tours and other activities so far in 92 countries.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2020, the company began seeing more demand for local travel in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The app was originally created as a replacement for pen and apper ledgers, but plans to introduce financial services including credit, savings and insurance. In August, the company integrated digital payments into its platform, enabling merchants to take customer payments from bank accounts and digital wallets like OVO and DANA. BukuWarung&#8217;s goal is to fill the same role for Indonesian merchants that KhataBook and OKCredit do in India.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons BukuWarung launched digital payments was in response to customer demand for contactless transactions and instant payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since introducing the feature, the company said it has already processed several million U.S. dollars in total payment volume (TPV) on an annualized basis. The company says it now serves about 1.2 million merchants across 750 locations in Indonesia, focusing on tier 2 and tier 3 cities.<\/p>\n<p>Digital payments is also the first step into building out BukuWarung\u2019s financial services, which will help differentiate it from other bookkeeping. The payments features is currently free and BukuWarung is experimenting with different monetization models, including making a small margin on fees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason why we launched payments is also very strategic, because there is a lot of pull in the market. We have already seen several millions annualized TPV in less than a month, because the payments we offer are cost-efficient as well and cheaper than to get from a bank,&#8221; Chauhan told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the Indian players, like Khatabook, they have also launched digital payments. The reason for that is because it&#8217;s a very essential step for building a business and monetization,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If you don\u2019t have payments, you can\u2019t do anything like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Chauhan added that building a financial services platform is the difference between providing a utility app that replaces bookkeeping ledgers, and becoming an essential service for merchants that will eventually include lending for working capital, savings and insurance products. The bookkeeping features on BukuWarung will feed into the financial services aspect by providing data to score creditworthiness, and help small merchants, who often have difficulty securing working capital from traditional banks, get access to lines of credit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A month after completing Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program, BukuWarung, an financial tech startup that serves small businesses in Indonesia, announced it has raised new funding from a roster of high-profile investors, including partners of DST Global, Soma Capital and 20VC.

which offers an online payments API for businesses in the Philippines, was the first Filipino-owned financial tech startup to take part in Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program. Y Combinator and Global Founders Capital, another previous investor, both returned for the Series A, which also included participation from new backer Bedrock Capital.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo partners with financial institutions, and its products include a payments API that can be integrated into websites and apps, allowing them to accept payments from bank cards and digital wallets like GrabPay and GCash. For social commerce sellers and other people who sell mostly through messaging apps, the startup offers PayMongo Links, which buyers can click on to send money. PayMongo\u2019s platform also includes features like a fraud and risk detection system.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a statement, Stripe\u2019s APAC business lead Noah Pepper said it invested in PayMongo because &#8220;we\u2019ve been impressed with the PayMongo team and the speed at which they\u2019ve made digital payments more accessible to so many businesses across the Philippines.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/25\/manila-based-payments-processing-startup-paymongo-raises-2-7-million-in-seed-funding\/\">launched in June 2019 with $2.7 million in seed funding<\/a>, which the founders said was one of the largest seed rounds ever raised by a Philippines-based fintech startup. PayMongo has now raised a total of almost $15 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>Co-founder and chief executive Francis Plaza said PayMongo has processed a total of almost $20 million in payments since launching, and grown at an average of 60% since the start of the year, with a surge after lockdowns began in March.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the company originally planned to start raising its Series A in the first half of next year, but the growth in demand for its services during COVID-19 prompted it to start the round earlier so it could hire for its product, design and engineering teams and speed up the release of new features. These will include more online payment options; features for invoicing and marketplaces; support for business models like subscriptions; and faster payout cycles.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo also plans to add more partnerships with financial service providers, improve its fraud and risk detection systems and secure more licenses from the central bank so it can start working on other types of financial products.<\/p>\n<p>The startup is among fintech companies in Southeast Asia that have seen accelerated growth as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/week-asia\/economics\/article\/3088351\/coronavirus-drives-southeast-asia-digitalisation-push-raising\">the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many businesses<\/a> to digitize more of their operations. Plaza said that overall digital transactions in the Philippines grew 42% between January and April because of the country\u2019s lockdowns.<\/p>\n<p>PayMongo is currently the only payments company in the Philippines with an onboarding process that was developed to be completely online, he added, which makes it attractive to merchants that are accepting online payments for the first time. &#8220;We have a more efficient review of compliance requirements for the expeditious approval of applications so that our merchants can use our platform right away and we make sure we have a fast payout to our merchants,&#8221; said Plaza.<\/p>\n<p>If the momentum continues even as lockdowns are lifted in different cities, that means the Philippine\u2019s central bank is on track to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketresearchphilippines.com\/insight\/the-philippines-e-payment-target-gets-promoted-during-quarantine\">reach its goal of increasing the volume of e-payment transactions to 20% of total transactions<\/a> in the country this year. The government <a href=\"https:\/\/unctad.org\/en\/pages\/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2409\">began setting policies in 2015 to encourage more online payments<\/a> in a bid to bolster economic growth and financial inclusion, since smartphone penetration in the Philippines is high, but many people don\u2019t have a traditional bank account, which often charge high fees.<\/p>\n<p>Though lockdown restrictions in the Philippines have eased, Plaza said PayMongo is still seeing strong traction. &#8220;We believe the digital shift by Filipino businesses will continue, largely because both merchants and customers continue to practice safety measures such as staying at home and choosing online shopping despite the more lenient quarantine levels.

Co-founder and chief executive officer Mario Suntanu told TechCrunch that the capital will be used to expand into more major cities and on developing its tech platform, including data analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Other participants in the round included returning investors <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/intudo-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"intudo-ventures\">Intudo Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Sovereign\u2019s Capital, and new backers Vectr Ventures, AppWorks, Quest Ventures, Coca-Cola Amatil X and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/palm-drivecapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"palm-drivecapital\">Palm Drive Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. The Series B brings Yummy Corporation&#8217;s total raised so far to $19.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in June 2019, Yummy Corporation\u2019s network of cloud kitchens, called Yummykitchen, now includes more than 70 HACCP-certified facilities in Jakarta, Bandung and Medan. It partners with more than 50 food and beverage (F&amp;B) companies, including major brands like Ismaya Group and Sour Sally Group.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>During COVID-19 movement restrictions, Suntanu said Yummykitchen&#8217;s business showed &#8220;healthy growth&#8221; as people, confined mostly to their homes, ordered food for delivery. Funding will be used to get more partners, especially brands that want to digitize their operations and expand deliveries to cope with the continuing impact of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>The number of cloud kitchens in Southeast Asia<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jumpstartmag.com\/indonesian-cloud-kitchen-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> has grown quickly over the past year<\/a>, driven by demand for food deliveries that began increasing even before the pandemic. But for F&amp;B brands that rely on deliveries for a good part of their revenue, running their own kitchens and staff can be cost-prohibitive. Sharing cloud kitchens with other businesses can help increase their margins.<\/p>\n<p>Other cloud kitchen startups serving Indonesia include Hangry and Everplate, but these companies and Yummy Corporation are all up against two major players: &#8220;super apps&#8221; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/grabtaxi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"grabtaxi\">Grab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Gojek, which both <a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Food-Beverage\/Southeast-Asia-s-cloud-kitchens-swell-powered-by-Grab-and-Gojek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operate large networks of cloud kitchens <\/a>that have the advantage of being integrated with their on-demand delivery services.<\/p>\n<p>Suntanu said Yummy&#8217;s main edge compared to other cloud kitchens is that it also offers fully managed location and kitchen operation services, in addition to kitchen facilities. This means Yummy&#8217;s partners, including restaurants and F&amp;B brands, don\u2019t need to hire their own teams. Instead, food preparation and delivery is handled by Yummy&#8217;s workers. The company also provides its clients with a data analytics platform to help them with targeted ad campaigns and making their listings more visible on food delivery apps.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Harris Yang, Southeast Asia associate at SoftBank Ventures Asia, said the firm invested in Yummy because &#8220;given the company\u2019s strong expertise in the F&amp;B industry and unique value proposition to brands, we believe that Yummy will continue to be the leader in this space. We are excited to support the team and help them scale their business in this emerging sector.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yummy Corporation, which claims to be the largest cloud kitchen management company in Indonesia, has raised $12 million in Series B funding, led by SoftBank Ventures Asia.

3<\/a>, its home appliance smart remote, in the United States and Canada today. Priced at $129, the Bluetooth-enabled Nature Remo 3 allows people to control with their smartphones or smart speakers multiple appliances that use an infrared remote, including air conditioners, TVs, robot vacuum cleaners and fans.<\/p>\n<p>Nature claims that its Remo series is Japan\u2019s top smart remote, with more than 200,000 units sold so far. The Nature Remo 3, designed to be mounted on a wall, also has sensors for temperature, humidity, lighting and movement, allowing users to create customized settings for when they want devices to turn on or shut off. Nature Remo 3\u2019s app also has a GPS location feature, so appliances can turn on automatically as users get closer to their homes.<\/p>\n<p>As COVID-19 forces people to spend more time at home than usual, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200723005099\/en\/Home-Improvement-Activity-Increases-During-COVID-19\">many are embarking on home improvement projects<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Even though people may be reluctant to purchase new appliances because of the economic downturn, relatively inexpensive products like the Nature Remo 3 may still attract buyers because it can help reduce energy consumed by devices they already own. The Nature Remo 3 also adds another layer of functionality to smart speakers and before the pandemic, global smart speaker sales <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/17\/smart-speaker-sales-reached-new-record-of-146-9m-in-2019-up-70-from-2018\/\">hit a record high last year, with 146.9 million units shipped<\/a>. The Nature Remo 3 is compatible with Amazon smart speakers like the Echo Dot, as well as Google Home and Apple HomePod speakers.<\/p>\n<p>Nature founder and chief executive Haruumi Shiode told TechCrunch that Nature conducted a pilot with Kansai Electric, one of the largest utility providers in Japan, to prove that it can lower the amount of electricity used by air conditioners. He added that the pandemic actually accelerated sales of Nature Remo devices in Japan and prompted the company\u2019s decision to launch in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made mass-producing the Nature Remo 3 more challenging because Nature\u2019s team was no longer able to make monthly trips to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/shenzhen-eb7c\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shenzhen-eb7c\">Shenzhen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Shiode said. But the Nature Remo 3 is the sixth product Nature has launched so far, so it was able to figure out how to work with factories remotely on production and quality assurance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I read that since the pandemic started, 70% of Americans are tackling home improvement projects,&#8221; Shiode added. &#8220;Similarly, people around the world have been looking for ways to make their shelter-in-place less mundane and more convenient.

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Syfe<\/a>, a Singapore-based startup that wants to make investing more accessible in Asia, announced today that it has closed a SGD $25.2 million (USD $18.6 million) Series A led by Valar Ventures, a fintech-focused investment firm.<\/p>\n<p>The round also included participation from Presight Capital and returning investor Unbound, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.syfe.com\/magazine\/syfe-raises-s5-2-million-to-launch-digital-wealth-manager-in-singapore\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">led Syfe&#8217;s seed funding<\/a> last year.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Founded in 2017 by chief executive officer Dhruv Arora, Syfe launched in July 2019. Like other investment apps including Robinhood, Acorns and Stash, Syfe&#8217;s goal is to make investing more accessible. There is no minimum amount required to start investing and its all-inclusive pricing structure ranges from .4% to .65% per year.<\/p>\n<p>Syfe serves customers based in 23 countries, but currently only actively markets it services in Singapore, where it is licensed under the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Part of its new funding will be used to expand into new Asian countries. The startup hasn&#8217;t disclosed its exact user numbers, but says the number of its customers and assets under management have increased tenfold since the beginning of the year, and almost half of its new clients were referred by existing users.<\/p>\n<p>Other <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/valar-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"valar-ventures\">Valar Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> portfolio companies include TransferWise, Xero and digital bank N26. In a statement about Syfe, founding partner Andrew McCormack said, &#8220;The potential of Asia as a region, with a fast-growing number of mass-affluent consumers aiming to grow their wealth, combined with the pedigree of the team and strong traction, makes Syfe a very compelling opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before starting Syfe, Arora was an investment banker at UBS Investment Bank in Hong Kong before serving as vice president of product and growth at Grofers, one of India\u2019s largest online grocery delivery services. While at UBS, Arora worked with exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I could see how a lot of institutions and some ultra-high-net worth individuals who are clients of the bank were using the product, and I thought it was a great tool for individuals, too,&#8221; Arora told TechCrunch. &#8220;But what I realized was that people are actually not very aware of how to use ETFs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In many Asian countries, people prefer to put their money away in bank accounts or invest in real estate. As interest rates and property prices stagnate, however, consumers are looking for other ways to invest. Syfe currently offers three investment products. The first is a global diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds and ETFs that is automatically managed according to each investor\u2019s chosen risk level. The second is a REIT portfolio based on the Singapore Exchange\u2019s iEdge S-REIT Leaders Index. Finally, Syfe\u2019s Equity100 portfolio consists of ETFs that include stocks from more than 1,500 companies around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Other Asia-focused &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; services include Stashaway and Kristal.ai, and Grab Financial also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/grab-launches-new-consumer-financial-services-including-micro-investments-and-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently announced<\/a> a &#8220;micro-investment&#8221; product. Arora acknowledges that in the future, there may be more entrants to the space. Right now, however, Syfe&#8217;s main competitor is the mindset that banks are still the best way to save money, he added. Part of Syfe\u2019s work is consumer education, because &#8220;it was culturally ingrained in a lot of us, myself included, to keep your money in the bank.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Syfe differentiates with a team of financial advisors, including former employees of Goldman Sachs, Citibank and Morgan Stanley, who are on hand for user consultations. Arora said most Syfe users talk to advisors when they first join the platform, and about 20% of them continue using the service. Questions have included if people should use a credit card to invest, which Arora said advisors dissuade them from doing because of high interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely want to be a tech-first platform, but we understand there is a value, especially as you deal with some of the older audiences who are in their 50s and 60s, who are still adapting to these technologies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They need to know that you know there is somebody out there to look after their products.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While Syfe\u2019s average user is aged between 30 to 45, one growing bracket is people in their 50s who are motivated to save for retirement, or want to create a supplement to their pension plan. Users typically start with an initial investment of about SGD $10,000 (about USD $7,340), and about four out of five users regularly top up that amount.<\/p>\n<p>Some users have tried other investment products, like investment-linked insurance plans, but for many, Arora says Syfe is their first introduction to investing in stocks, bonds and ETFs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve realized that a fair number of them are quite well-to-do professionals in their field, in their mid to late 30s, who amassed a significant amount of wealth but never really had a chance to invest, or the right advice on how to invest,&#8221; said Arora. &#8220;I think this has been one of the biggest revelations for us and it made us realize we should have a human touch in our platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The platform manages its products with a mix of an investment team and algorithms that help avoid human bias, said Arora. Syfe&#8217;s algorithms take into account growth versus value, the market cap of a stock, volatility and sector momentum. To balance risk, it also analyzes how individual assets correlate with other assets in the same portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>Arora said Syfe is currently in advanced talks with regulators in several countries and expects to be in at least two new markets by the end of next year. It also plans to double the size of its team and create more consumer financial products.<\/p>\n<p>During COVID-19, Arora said Syfe&#8217;s portfolios experienced significantly lower corrections than indexes like the S&amp;P, so only a few users withdrew their money. In fact, many invested more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel people have been rethinking their finances and the future,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As banks cut interest rates across the world, including in Singapore, many of them have started looking at other options.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Syfe, a Singapore-based startup that wants to make investing more accessible in Asia, announced today that it has closed a SGD $25.2 million (USD $18.6 million) Series A led by Valar Ventures, a fintech-focused investment firm.

between Chinese and United States tech companies has undergone dramatic shifts. Once seen as a promising market for American companies, that narrative flipped as China\u2019s tech innovation and investment power became increasingly evident, and the expanding reach of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s cybersecurity regulations fueled concerns about data privacy. For years, however, there still seemed to be room for a flow of ideas between the two countries. But that promise has eroded, against the backdrop of the tariff wars and, most recently, the Trump administration\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> executive orders against TikTok and WeChat<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Commerce Department was set to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/18\/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday\/\">enforce the shutdown of TikTok and WeChat in the United States<\/a> last weekend, but both apps got reprieves. In <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/we-chat\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"we-chat\">WeChat&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> case, a U.S. district court judge <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">issued a temporary stay against the ban<\/a>, while TikTok owner ByteDance is in the process of finalizing a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/tiktok-wtf\/\">complicated deal with Oracle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and WeChat imbroglios underline how much America\u2019s perception of Chinese tech has evolved. Not only is TikTok the first consumer app by a Chinese company to gain a major foothold in the United States, but it&#8217;s also had a significant impact on popular culture there. This would have been almost unimaginable just ten, or even five, years ago.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2>China as a target for expansion<\/h2>\n<p>For a long time, China, with its population of 1.4 billion people, was seen as a lucrative market by many foreign tech companies, even as government censorship began to expand. In 2003, China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security launched the Golden Shield Project, commonly referred to as the Great Firewall of China, the apparatus that controls what overseas sites and apps Chinese internet users have access to. At first the Great Firewall mainly targeted access to Chinese-language sites with anti-Chinese Communist Party content. Then it began blocking more services.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049894\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-111656627.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049894\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049894\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-111656627.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A laptop computer screen in Beijing shows the homepage of Google.cn, 26 January 2006, a day after its debut in mainland China where the US online search engine launched a new service after agreeing to censor websites and content banned by the Beijing authorities (AFP PHOTO\/Frederic J.

BROWN)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Even as the Communist Party&#8217;s online censorship became more stringent, many American internet companies were still keen to expand into China. Perhaps the most prominent example from that era is Google, which added Chinese support to Google.com in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Though access to the search engine was spotty (according to <a href=\"http:\/\/ig-legacy.ft.com\/content\/faf86fbc-0009-11df-8626-00144feabdc0#axzz6YiqGAKbD\">a 2010 timeline from the Financial Times<\/a>, this may have been because of &#8220;extensive filtering&#8221; by China\u2019s licensed internet service providers) and it was briefly blocked in 2002, Google continued launching new services targeted to users in China, including a simplified Chinese language version of Google News.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 2005, the company announced plans to set up a research and development center in China. The next year, it officially launched Google.cn. In order to do so, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0cf3fc52-8d0b-11da-9daf-0000779e2340\">agreed to exclude search results on sensitive political topics<\/a>, causing controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its concessions to the Chinese government, Google\u2019s relationship with China began deteriorating, foreshadowing what other foreign tech companies, particularly those offering online services, would deal with when they tried to enter China. After being blocked on and off, access to YouTube was completely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2009\/mar\/25\/china-blocks-youtube\">cut off in 2009 <\/a>after footage was uploaded that appeared to show the brutal beatings of Tibetan protestors in Lhasa. That year, China also blocked access to Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2010, Google <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/asia-pacific\/8582233.stm\">announced it was no longer willing to censor searches in China<\/a> and would withdraw from the country if necessary. It also began redirecting all search queries on Google.cn to Google.com.hk.<\/p>\n<p>But the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-pulls-out-of-china-2010-3\">continued its R&amp;D operations there and maintained a sales team<\/a>. (In 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/collections\/google-dragonfly-china\/\">an investigation by The Intercept<\/a> found that Google had started to work on a censored search engine for China again, code-named &#8220;Project Dragonfly&#8221;). Other big U.S. tech companies also continued courting China, even though their services were blocked there.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg made several trips to China in the mid-2010s, including a 2015 visit to Tsinghua University, a leading research university. Zuckerberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn\/en\/aboutsem\/advMem.html\">had joined the university\u2019s board the previous year<\/a>, and delivered several public talks in Mandarin. Speculation mostly focused on Facebook\u2019s efforts to get a version of its service into China, but China-based companies were, and continue to be, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/07\/technology\/facebook-china-internet.html\">one of Facebook\u2019s most important sources of advertising revenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Chinese government policies designed to help domestic companies become more competitive also began to have an impact and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/r-in-china-us-tech-firms-turn-to-domestic-rivals-for-survival-2015-1\">by 2015<\/a>, many American tech firms needed to find a local partner to enter China. The narrative that China needed American tech innovation began to turn on its head.<\/p>\n<h2>A shifting dynamic<\/h2>\n<p>Since Google Play was also blocked in China, that led the way for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/insights\/a-breakdown-of-chinas-android-market\/\">rise of third-party Android app stores<\/a>, including Chinese internet giant Tencent\u2019s My App.<\/p>\n<p>But Tencent\u2019s most influential product is WeChat, the messenger that launched in 2011. Two years later, Tencent added mobile payments by integrating it with TenPay. In less than five years, WeChat became<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3065255\/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money\">\u00a0a vital part of daily life<\/a> for hundreds of millions of users in China. WeChat Pay and Alibaba\u2019s Alipay, its main competitor, have revolutionized payments in China, where about one-third of consumer payments are now cashless, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cgap.org\/research\/publication\/china-digital-payments-revolution\">according to research by think tank CGAP<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049896\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1228585197.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049896\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2049896\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-1228585197.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"BEIJING, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 19: A Chinese customer uses his mobile to pay via a QR code with the WeChat app at a local market on September 19, 2020 in Beijing, China.

(Photo by Kevin Frayer\/Getty Images)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/09\/wechat-mini-programs\/\">Wechat launched \u201cmini-programs,\u201d<\/a> that allows developers to create &#8220;apps within an app&#8221; that run on WeChat. The program took off quickly, and within less than two years, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/07\/wechat-mini-apps-200-million-users\/\">Tencent said<\/a> it had reached one million mini-programs and 200 million daily users. Even Google<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/17\/google-launches-its-first-wechat-mini-program\/\"> quietly launched <\/a>its own mini-program in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its ubiquity in China, WeChat\u2019s international presence is relatively small, especially when compared to other messengers like WhatsApp. WeChat claims more than one billion monthly active users in total, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/wechat-statistics\/\">only an estimated 100 million to 200 million are international users.<\/a> Many are members of the Chinese diaspora who use it to keep in touch with family and associates in mainland China since many other popular messengers, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Line, are blocked there. Though Tencent<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-wechat-trump-factbox-idUSKCN2530K8\"> is a major investor in many U.S. companies<\/a>, including Tesla, Riot Games, and Snap, and has been<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/10\/26\/chinese-internet-giant-tencent-rumored-to-be-considering-a-stake-in-snapchat\/\"> cited as a source of inspiration<\/a> by tech leaders including Snap founder Evan Spiegel, it hasn&#8217;t launched an international breakout app.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, another company was gaining ascendancy, and would eventually succeed where Tencent hadn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2012 by Microsoft veteran Zhang Yiming, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> had its own early run-ins with the Chinese government. The first app it launched, a social media platform called Neihan Duanzi that reached 200 million users by 2017, was shut down the next year after the National Radio and Television Administration <a href=\"https:\/\/foreignpolicy.com\/2019\/01\/16\/bytedance-cant-outrun-beijings-shadow\">accused it of hosting inappropriate content<\/a>. Despite that early setback, ByteDance continued to grow, releasing apps like Toutiao, one of China\u2019s top news aggregators.<\/p>\n<p>But the product it is best known for launched in 2016. Called Douyin in China, ByteDance always planned to expand the short video-sharing app overseas. In an interview with Chinese tech news site 36Kr, <a href=\"https:\/\/kr-asia.com\/a-closer-look-at-tik-toks-expansion-overseas\">Zhang said<\/a>, &#8220;China is home to only one-fifth of the world\u2019s internet users. If we don\u2019t expand globally, we are bound to lose to our peers eyeing the rest of the world&#8221; \u2014 both echoing and contravening the viewpoint of U.S. internet companies that had seen China as a crucial market.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok, the international version of Douyin, was launched in 2017.\u00a0That year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/09\/chinas-toutiao-is-buying-musical-ly-in-a-deal-worth-800m-1b\">ByteDance also bought Musical.ly<\/a>, a lip-syncing app popular with teens, in a deal worth between $800 million to $1 billion. ByteDance <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/02\/musically-tiktok\/\">merged Musical.ly with TikTok<\/a>, consolidating their audiences.<\/p>\n<p>By early 2019, TikTok had become popular among teens and people in their early 20s, though <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/29\/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok\">many older people still struggled to understand its appeal<\/a>. But as TikTok was turning into a mainstay of Gen Z culture, it also began to face scrutiny by the U.S. government. In February 2019, the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/27\/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate\">fined TikTok $5.7 million for violating children\u2019s privacy laws<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Then a few months later, the U.S. government reportedly began a national security review of TikTok, marking the first in a chain of events that led to Trump\u2019s August executive order against the company, and ByteDance&#8217;s new, but confusing, agreement with &#8220;trusted technology partner&#8221; Oracle.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HOlCxD7PVo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/tiktok-fact-checks-us-ipo-chinese-ownership-5b-in-taxes\/\">TikTok fact checks: US IPO, Chinese ownership, $5B in taxes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TikTok fact checks: US IPO, Chinese ownership, $5B in taxes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/tiktok-fact-checks-us-ipo-chinese-ownership-5b-in-taxes\/embed\/#?secret=HOlCxD7PVo\" data-secret=\"HOlCxD7PVo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>The impact of China&#8217;s 2017 cybersecurity law<\/h2>\n<p>The United States is not the only country where TikTok has been deemed a national security threat. In June, it was among 59 apps developed by Chinese companies banned in India for threatening the country\u2019s &#8220;national security and defence.&#8221; It\u2019s also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/tiktok-is-being-investigated-by-frances-data-watchdog\/\">under investigation by French data security watchdog CNIL<\/a> over how it handles user data.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/tiktok-ban-us-national-security-risk\">some cybersecurity experts believe<\/a> that TikTok\u2019s data collection practices are similar to other social media apps that depend on targeted ads for revenue, the heart of the issue is a Chinese law, <a href=\"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2017\/06\/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know\/\">implemented in June 2017<\/a>, that requires companies to comply with government requests for data stored in China. ByteDance has insisted repeatedly it would resist attempts by the Chinese government to access U.S. users\u2019 data, which it says is stored in the United States and Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law,&#8221; TikTok wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/statement-on-tiktoks-content-moderation-and-data-security-practices\">October 2019 statement<\/a>. &#8220;Further, we have a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the same post, TikTok also addressed concerns that it censors content, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/09\/15\/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience\/\">videos about the Hong Kong protests<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/27\/tiktok-apologizes-for-removing-viral-video-about-abuses-against-uighurs-blames-a-human-moderation-error\/\">China\u2019s treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim groups<\/a>. &#8220;We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period,&#8221; the company said.<\/p>\n<h2>WeChat and TikTok&#8217;s uncertain future in the U.S.<\/h2>\n<p>But as a Chinese company, ByteDance is ultimately still beholden to Chinese laws. Earlier this week, ByteDance <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/tiktok-fact-checks-us-ipo-chinese-ownership-5b-in-taxes\/\">said it will retain an 80% stake in TikTok, after selling a total of 20% to Oracle and Walmart<\/a>. Then Oracle executive vice president Ken Glueck said that Oracle and Walmart would make their investment upon the creation of a new entity called TikTok Global. He added that ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.<\/p>\n<p>This creates more questions, but doesn\u2019t answer the most pressing one: how close will the U.S. version of TikTok remain to ByteDance, and will it still be subject to the Chinese cybersecurity regulations that cause so much concern?<\/p>\n<p>Around the same time that ByteDance&#8217;s proposed deal with Oracle and Walmart was announced, a U.S. district court judge temporarily stayed the nationwide ban on WeChat, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/justice-department-says-wechat-users-wont-be-penalized-under-trumps-executive-order\/\">part of a case brought against the U.S. government<\/a> by the <a href=\"https:\/\/uswua.org\/\">U.S. WeChat Users Alliance<\/a>, a nonprofit organization initiated by attorneys who want to preserve access to WeChat for users in America. In her opinion, Judge Laurel Beeler wrote, &#8220;while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national-security concerns\u2014it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ScMpBUqcEM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/\">Trump administration\u2019s WeChat ban is blocked by US district court<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Trump administration\u2019s WeChat ban is blocked by US district court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/trump-administrations-wechat-ban-is-blocked-by-u-s-district-court\/embed\/#?secret=ScMpBUqcEM\" data-secret=\"ScMpBUqcEM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>On its site, the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance said it believes Trump\u2019s August 6 executive order against WeChat &#8220;violates many provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.&#8221; Furthermore, the group argued that a WeChat ban would &#8220;severely affect the lives and the work of millions of people in the U.S.&#8221; who use WeChat to talk to family, friends and business associates in China.<\/p>\n<p>While WeChat is heavily censored, users have often found ingenious ways to bypass bans on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. For example, people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanhatesthis\/china-is-arresting-people-for-spreading-rumors-online-about\">used emojis, PDFs and fictional languages like Klingon<\/a> to share an interview with Ai Fen, the director of Wuhan Central Hospital&#8217;s emergency department and one of the first whistleblowers to sound the alarm about COVID-19 even as the government attempted to stifle information about the disease.<\/p>\n<h2>The growing divide<\/h2>\n<p>The U.S. government&#8217;s actions against TikTok and WeChat are taking place against an increasingly fraught political landscape. Huawei and ZTE were first identified as potential threats to U.S. national security in a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/09\/us\/us-panel-calls-huawei-and-zte-national-security-threat.html\"> 2012 bipartisan House committee report<\/a>, but legal actions against Huawei, one of the world\u2019s biggest telecom equipment suppliers, escalated under the Trump administration. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/28\/huawei-us-meng-wanzhou-doj\">These include<\/a> criminal charges brought against Huawei by the Department of Justice, and the arrest and indictment of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government\u2019s actions in the name of national security doesn&#8217;t just affect the Chinese government or China&#8217;s biggest companies. It also impacts individuals, as in the case of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/07\/25\/us\/politics\/visa-restrictions-chinese-students.html\">increasingly stringent visa restrictions for Chinese students.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the Great Firewall has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/2018\/jun\/29\/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\">become more restrictive under President Xi Jinping\u2019s regime <\/a>and China\u2019s cybersecurity laws are becoming increasingly invasive, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/blogs\/new-perspectives-asia\/who-benefits-chinas-cybersecurity-laws\">granting the government even more access to citizens\u2019 data<\/a>. Increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology has been used to monitor Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, and a crackdown on VPN services that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2017\/jan\/23\/china-vpn-cleanup-great-firewall-censorship\"> began escalating in 2017<\/a> is making it harder for people in China to circumvent the Great Firewall.<\/p>\n<p>When compared to these social issues, the future of a video-sharing app might seem relatively minor. But it underscores one of the most unsettling developments in the relationship between U.S. and China over the past ten years.<\/p>\n<p>In a prescient 2016 Washington Post article titled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/asia_pacific\/america-wants-to-believe-china-cant-innovate-tech-tells-a-different-story\/2016\/07\/19\/c17cbea9-6ee6-479c-81fa-54051df598c5_story.html\">&#8220;America wants to believe China can\u2019t innovate. Tech tells a different story,&#8221;<\/a> Emily Rauhala wrote &#8220;China\u2019s tech scene is flourishing in a parallel universe.&#8221; TikTok&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/10\/style\/tiktok-ban-us-users-influencers-taylor-lorenz.html\">deep cultural impact<\/a> gave a glimpse of what is possible when two parallel universes connect. Along with geopolitical tensions, the furore over TikTok and WeChat uncovers something else: that the exchange of ideas and information between people in two of the world&#8217;s most powerful countries is becoming increasingly restricted due to circumstances beyond their control.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past decade, the dynamic between Chinese and United States tech companies has undergone dramatic shifts.

pandemic, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/\">Grab<\/a> was no exception. The company is one of the most highly-valued tech startups in Southeast Asia, where it operates in eight countries. Its transport business suffered a sharp decline in March and April, as movement restriction orders were implemented.<\/p>\n<p>But the company had the advantage of already operating several on-demand logistics services. During Disrupt, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/russell-cohen\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"russell-cohen\">Russell Cohen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Grab\u2019s group managing director of operations, talked about how the company adapted its technology for an unprecedented crisis (the video is embedded below).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We sat down as a leadership group at the start of the crisis and we could see, particularly in Southeast Asia, that the scale of the challenge was so immense,&#8221; said Cohen.<\/p>\n<p>Grab\u2019s driver app already allowed them to toggle between ride-hailing and on-demand delivery requests. As a result of COVID-19, more than 149,000 drivers began performing on-demand deliveries for the first time, with Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand seeing the most conversions. That number included tens of thousands of new drivers who joined the platform to make up for lost earnings during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge was scaling up its delivery services to meet the dramatic increase in demand by consumers, and also merchants who needed a new way to reach customers. In March and April, Cohen said just under 80,000 small businesses joined its platform. Many had never sold online before, so Grab expedited the release of a self-service feature, making it easier for merchants to on-board themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a massive sector of the Southeast Asian economy that effectively digitized within a matter of weeks,\u201d said Cohen.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the new merchants had previously taken only cash payments, so Grab had to set them up for digital payments, a process made simpler because the company&#8217;s financial unit, Grab Financial, already offers services like Grab Pay for cashless payments, mobile wallets and remittance services.<\/p>\n<p>Grab also released a new package of tools called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/sg\/merchant\/food\/\">Grab Merchant<\/a>, which enabled merchants to set up online businesses by submitting licenses and certification online, and includes features like data analytics.<\/p>\n<h3>Modeling for uncertainty in the &#8220;new normal&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Part of Grab\u2019s COVID-19 strategy involved collaborating with local municipalities and governments in different countries to make deliveries more efficient. For example, it worked with the Singaporean government to expand a pilot program, called<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/sg\/press\/others\/grab-announces-additional-covid-19-support-measures\/\"> GrabExpress Car<\/a>, originally launched in September, that enabled more of Grab\u2019s ride-hailing vehicles to be used for food and grocery deliveries. Previously, many of those deliveries were handled only by motorbikes.<\/p>\n<p>The situation in each of Grab\u2019s markets &#8212; Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam &#8212; is still evolving. Some markets have lifted lockdown orders, while others continue to cope with new outbreaks.<\/p>\n<p>Cohen said ride-hailing is gradually recovering in many of Grab\u2019s markets. But the company is preparing for an uncertain future by modeling different scenarios, taking into account potential re-closings, and long-lasting changes in both consumer and merchant behavior.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnpredictability is something we think a lot about,\u201d Cohen said. Its models include ones where deliveries are a significantly larger part of its business, because even in countries where movement restrictions have been lifted, customers still prefer to shop online.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has also accelerated the adoption of digital payments in several of Grab&#8217;s markets. For example, Grab <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/ph\/press\/tech-product\/grab-everything-online-grab-releases-digital-first-grabpay-card-in-the-philippines-powered-by-mastercard\/\">launched its GrabPay Card in the Philippines three months ago<\/a>, because more people are beginning to use contactless payments in response to COVID-19 concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of on-demand deliveries, the company is expanding GrabExpress, its same-day courier service, and adapting technology originally created for ride-pooling to help drivers plan pickups and deliveries more efficiently. This will help decrease the cost of delivery services as consumers remain price-conscious because of the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPurchasing behaviors have changed, so for us, when we think about the supply side, the drivers\u2019 side, that means we\u2019ve got to make sure our fleet is flexible,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fcd\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ride-hailing services around the world have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Grab was no exception.

Kaisei Hamamoto on how the app deals with media polarization"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Six years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartnews.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmartNews<\/a> took on a major challenge. After launching in Japan in 2012, the news discovery app decided that its first international market would be the United States. During Disrupt 2020, co-founder Kaisei Hamamoto talked about how <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/smartnews-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"smartnews-inc\">SmartNews <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> adapts its app for two very different markets (the video is embedded below). Hamamoto, who is also chief operating officer and chief engineer of the startup, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/04\/news-discovery-app-smartnews-valued-at-1-1b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hit unicorn status last year<\/a>, also dove into how the company deals with media polarization, especially in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>At Disrupt, SmartNews announced a roster of major new features for the U.S. version of the app, including sections dedicated to voting information and articles related to local and national elections. Hamamoto said the SmartNews\u2019 goal is to make the app a &#8220;one-stop solution for users\u2019 participation in the election process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Vswu4zWlh6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/smartnews-u-s-app-unveils-new-features-for-the-elections-covid-19-and-local-weather\/\">SmartNews&#8217; U.S. app unveils new features for the elections, COVID-19 and local weather<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SmartNews&#8217; U.S. app unveils new features for the elections, COVID-19 and local weather&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/17\/smartnews-u-s-app-unveils-new-features-for-the-elections-covid-19-and-local-weather\/embed\/#?secret=Vswu4zWlh6\" data-secret=\"Vswu4zWlh6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The media landscape has changed a lot since SmartNews was founded in 2012. In the U.S., SmartNews is tackling the same issues as many journalists are: increasing polarization, especially along political lines, and monetization (SmartNews currently has more than 3,000 publishing partners around the world and splits ad revenue with them). And, of course, it&#8217;s up against a host of new competitors, including Apple News and Google News.<\/p>\n<p>While many Japanese startups focus on other Asian markets when expanding internationally, SmartNews decided to enter the United States because it is home to some of the most influential media companies in the world. On the engineering side, Hamamoto said the company also wanted to tap into the country\u2019s AI and machine learning talent pool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The U.S. is not only an attractive market, but also an important development center for SmartNews,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Japanese and American versions of SmartNews share the same code base, and its offices in both countries work closely together. While the company&#8217;s machine learning-based algorithms drive the bulk of news discovery and personalized recommendations, publishers are first screened by SmartNews&#8217; content team before being added to its platform. The company&#8217;s vice president of content is Rich Jaroslovsky, a veteran journalist who wrote for publications like Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal.<\/p>\n<p>While AI-based algorithms can perform tasks like filtering out obscene images, &#8220;it does not have the ability to evaluate how each publisher meets certain standards,&#8221; Hamamoto said. &#8220;We are doing everything we can to ensure that our users can read the news with trust every day thanks to efforts led by our team of journalism experts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Breaking readers out of information bubbles<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to their code base, the two versions of the app share some of the same features. For example, each has SmartNews\u2019 COVID-19 channel, with continuous updates about the pandemic. In the States, this includes visualizations of confirmed cases by county or state, and information about local closing or reopening orders.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of adapting the apps&#8217; user experience, Hamamoto said Japanese readers prefer to have a lot of news displayed on one screen, so it uses a layout algorithm that deliberately increases the density of information presented in its Japanese app. But testing showed Americans prefer a simpler, cleaner layout with more white space.<\/p>\n<p>But the differences go beyond the apps&#8217; user interface. In 2016, members of the U.S. and Japanese team spent three weeks traveling across 13 states, including Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas, to talk to people they met through Craigslist postings or in diners and cafes. SmartNews\u2019 leaders decided to do this after the Japan team realized that most of their U.S. trips were to their offices in New York and the Bay Area.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew we couldn\u2019t get a get a true sense of America by only visiting the East Coast and West Coast,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hamamoto said one of his biggest takeaways from the 2016 trip was that &#8220;we tend to categorize people into just two segments, our side or the other side, and we tend to think of the other side as the enemy, but in reality the world is not that simple.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a bid to tackle political polarization in American media, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/16\/smartnews-latest-news-discovery-feature-shows-users-articles-from-across-the-political-spectrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched a &#8220;News from All Sides&#8221;<\/a> feature last year, that displays articles about one topic from publications displayed on a slider from &#8220;most conservative&#8221; to &#8220;most liberal.&#8221; The U.S. app<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/03\/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities\/\"> also has a stronger emphasis on local news<\/a>. Based on users\u2019 locations, this can be as specific as information from county or even city news outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Hamamoto added that one of SmartNews&#8217; guiding principles is a belief that &#8220;having a willingness to listen to other people and not easily label them will help solve the division of our society.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26b65dff2c9a07d8ed\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Six years ago, SmartNews took on a major challenge.

Though WeChat is the top messaging app by far in China, where it also serves as an essential conduit for payments and other services, the U.S. version of the app has relatively limited features. It is used by Chinese-Americans, and other members of the Chinese disapora in the U.S., to keep in touch with their family and other people in China. With other popular messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, banned in China, WeChat is often the most direct communication channel available to them.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government\u2019s filing (embedded below) was made as part of a request for a preliminary injunction against the executive order brought by the <a href=\"https:\/\/uswua.org\/\">U.S. WeChat Users Alliance<\/a>, a nonprofit organization initiated by attorneys who want to preserve access to WeChat for users in the U.S. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>In it, attorneys from the Justice Department said the U.S. Commerce Department is continuing to review transactions and will clarify which ones are affected by September 20, but &#8220;we can provide assurances that [Secretary Ross] does not intend to take actions that would target persons or groups whose only connection to WeChat is their use or downloading of the app to convey personal or business information between users, or otherwise define the relevant transaction in such a way that would impose criminal or civil liability on such users.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But in a response (also embedded below), the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance said that the Department of Justice\u2019s filing instead demonstrates why a preliminary injunction is necessary. &#8220;Having first failed to articulate any actual national security concerns, the administration\u2019s latest &#8216;assurances&#8217; that users can keep using WeChat, and exchange their personal and business information, only further illustrates the hollowness and pre-textual nature of the Defendants&#8217; &#8216;national security rationales.&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. WeChat Users Alliance filed for the injunction on August 21. In an open letter published on its site, it said a complete ban of WeChat &#8220;will severely affect the lives and the work of millions of people in the U.S. They will have a difficult time talking to family relatives and friends back in China. Countless people or businesses who use WeChat to develop and contact customers will also suffer significant economic losses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The group also believes that the executive order &#8220;violates many provisions of the U.S. Constitution,&#8221; and the Administrative Procedure Act.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/476351147\/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-A2doQPZVJVE73jz3tG0l\"  data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_476351147\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/476351147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/476351421\/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-YWd1rsvNcakU0ZihHUna\"  data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_476351421\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/476351421\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a Wednesday filing in federal court, the United States government said that users who use or download WeChat &#8220;to convey personal or business information&#8221; will not be subject to penalties under President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning transactions with the Tencent-owned messaging app. Trump issued the executive order against WeChat on August 6, the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4330449,"featured_media":2047954,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","carmot_uuid":"3bc69c8f-f95e-37a5-9d4f-b37ac04e09d8"},"categories":[449557102,13217,17396],"tags":[449557076,865614,108919,34932559,449558094,542665,5938293,1100288,32758280],"crunchbase_tag":[576607536],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/GettyImages-861781526.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2ZMC4FY","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"wechat","cb_name":"WeChat","cb_slug":"we-chat-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/we-chat"},{"slug":"president-donald-trump","cb_name":"Donald J.

Obviously, the onset of COVID-19 curtailed travel, but they continued talking to startups through video calls and emails.<\/p>\n<p>Lightspeed focuses on early-stage investments and has already invested in some of the most prolific startups in Southeast Asia, including Grab. Its other portfolio companies in the region are Indonesian startups Chilibeli, a social commerce platform, B2B wholesale marketplace Ula and e-commerce logistics platform Shipper, as well as Singaporean software developer NextBillion.AI.<\/p>\n<p>Some of Lightspeed\u2019s investments in other countries have also taken a keen interest in Southeast Asia as a key market for global expansion, including Indian startups OYO Rooms, Darwinbox and Yellow Messenger.<\/p>\n<p>Having regional operations will allow Lightspeed to work more closely with its portfolio companies and make deeper connections with entrepreneurs, Bhushan said.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the pandemic has prompted the rapid adoption of technologies, including platforms that help small businesses digitize their operations or sell online, supply chain solutions and remote working or online education-related services.<\/p>\n<p>In sectors like fintech or logistics, there is also a lot of opportunity in several Southeast Asian countries to build transformative platforms and services. For example, Bhushan said, Shipper is focused on solving some of the biggest supply chain and logistics challenges facing e-commerce sellers in Indonesia, while Grab has made digital payments and other financial services like insurance easier to access.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The big opportunity in most emerging markets, and this applies to most of the markets in Southeast Asia, is that we generally find that a lot of the fundamental infrastructure is broken, and founders can leverage technology to fill those gaps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What excites us are founders who are solving those infrastructural problems, and a lot of our investments are to that effect.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners announced the launch of its Southeast Asia operations today.

It has since launched in Malaysia and yesterday <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/homage-announces-strategic-partnership-with-infocom-one-of-japans-largest-healthcare-it-providers\/\">announced a new strategic investment from Infocom<\/a>, one of the largest healthcare technology companies in Japan. The partnership will enable Homage to accelerate its Asia-Pacific expansion.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Before starting Homage, Tee was co-founder of New York-based Rocketrip. A ticket-booking platform created to reduce work travel-related costs for companies, Rocketrip attracted investors like Google Ventures, Y Combinator and Bessemer Ventures, and raised more than $30 million. But in 2016, Tee decided to return to Singapore, her home country, after living abroad for about 15 years. In her Disrupt session, Tee said this was to be closer to her mother, and because she felt that her startup experience could also be applied to Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Tee knew that she wanted to launch another company, but she didn\u2019t decide to tackle the caregiving space immediately. That idea materialized when several of her close relatives were diagnosed with chronic conditions that needed specialized care.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn\u2019t know how to cope or how even to start thinking about what was required, and that was when I realized, wow, I needed to get myself schooled in many ways,&#8221; Tee said.<\/p>\n<p>Many families around the world are dealing with the same challenges as their populations age and social dynamics shift. Family members who traditionally would have been carers for relatives are unable to do so because they have moved away or need to work.<\/p>\n<p>Families often rely on word-of-mouth or agencies to find caregivers, a complicated, time-intensive and often emotionally difficult process. Homage uses matching algorithms to make it easier. One of the most unique things about the platform is how much detail it goes into. Providers are not only screened based on their certifications and the kind of care they provide (for example, long-term care, respite care, physical therapy or rehabilitation), but specific skills. For example, many patients need mobility assistance, so Homage assesses what kind of transfers they are able to safely perform.<\/p>\n<p>Then its matching technology decides which caregivers are best suited for a patient, and final assignments are made by Homage&#8217;s staff. By streamlining the process, Homage also lowers its costs, making its services accessible to more people while increasing pay rates for providers.<\/p>\n<p>Better pay taps into another one of Homage&#8217;s goals: expanding the caregiving pool in its markets and retaining talent. Other ways it addresses the issue is by placing caregivers on its platform into the jobs they are best suited for, organizing continuing education programs and making sure they are not over-scheduled. Some caregivers on the platform have long-term contracts, while others work with Homage clients only a few days a week.<\/p>\n<h3>A holistic approach to &#8220;age-tech&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>In June, Homage <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/singapore-based-caregiving-startup-launches-homage-health-for-online-and-home-medical-consultations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched its telehealth service<\/a>. Called Homage Health, the platform has been in development for a while, but its launch was accelerated because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote consultations fit into the &#8220;high-touch,&#8221; or in-person, care side of the company\u2019s business because many patients need regular screenings or consultations with doctors and specialists. For patients who have limited mobility or are immunocompromised, this makes it easier for them to make routine consults.<\/p>\n<p>Hardware, including wearable sensors, also show promise to identify potential health issues, like heart conditions, before they require acute care, but one challenge is making them easier for patients to integrate into their daily routines or remember to wear, Tee said.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Homage\u2019s mission is to create a holistic platform that covers many caregiving needs. Its new partnership with strategic investor Infocom will help bring that forward because the company, which Tee said Homage has been talking to for several years, works with about 13,000 facilities in Japan, including senior residences and hospitals. Infocom develops software for a wide range of verticals, including drug, hospital and medical record management, and medical imaging.<\/p>\n<p>Infocom also runs its own caregiving platform, and its partnership with Homage will enable the two companies to collaborate and reach more patients. Japan has one of the largest populations of elderly people in the world. Tee said at minimum, half a million caregivers need to be mobilized within the next five to 10 years in Japan in order to meet demand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to start building infrastructure to enable people to be able to access the kind of care services that they need, and so we really align in terms of that mission with Infocom,&#8221; said Tee. &#8220;They also have a platform that engages caregivers to apply for jobs in Japan and they see the Homage model as being particularly applicable because it\u2019s curated as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fc3\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s always a pleasure to chat with Homage co-founder and chief executive Gillian Tee because of her nuanced take on how technology can help elderly and other vulnerable people.

The company, which currently operates in Singapore and Malaysia, focuses on patients who need long-term rehabilitation or care services, especially elderly people. This makes it a good match for Japan, where more than one in five of its population is currently aged 65 or over. In the next decade, <a href=\"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2019\/11\/how-does-japans-aging-society-affect-its-economy\/\">that number is expected to increase to about one in three<\/a>, making the need for caregiving services especially acute.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The deal includes a regional partnership that will enable Homage to launch its services into Japan, and Infocom to expand its reach in Southeast Asia. Homage\u2019s services include a caregiver-client matching platform and a home medical service that includes online consultations and house calls, while Infocom\u2019s technology covers a wide range of verticals, including digital healthcare, radiology, pharmaceuticals, medical imaging and hospital information management.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement about the strategic investment, Mototaka Kuboi, Infocom&#8217;s managing executive officer and head of its healthcare business division, said, &#8220;We see Homage as an ideal partner given the company\u2019s unique cutting-edge technology and market leadership in the long-term care segment, and we aim to drive business growth not only in Homage\u2019s core and rapidly growing market in Southeast Asia, but also regionally.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Homage, a Singapore-based caregiving and telehealth company, has taken a major step in its global expansion plan.

CashKaro)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cashkaro.com\/\">CashKaro<\/a>, one of the leading cashback and coupon sites in India, will expand its range of services for e-commerce after raising $10 million in Series B funding, the New Delhi-based startup announced today. The round was led by Korea Investment Partners, with participation from returning investor Kalaari Capital.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/16\/cashkaro\/\">last covered CashKaro five years ago<\/a> when it raised a $3.8 million Series A. The latest round brings the company\u2019s total funding so far to $15 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Over the past five years, the company has introduced new products, including a price comparison service, and <a href=\"https:\/\/earnkaro.com\/\">EarnKaro<\/a>, a social commerce cashback app that launched about 18 months ago. Part of the Series B will be used to expand EarnKaro, which has about one million registered users. It allows social commerce sellers, or people who use social media platforms and messaging apps like WhatsApp to sell items, make extra cash by creating affiliate links to major e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart. The launch of EarnKaro also allowed CashKaro to reach into smaller cities and rural areas, where shoppers often prefer to order from people whose recommendations they trust (i.e. &#8220;micro-influencers&#8221;) instead of e-commerce sites.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by husband-and-wife team Swati and Rohan Bhargava, CashKaro currently claims about five million users and has partnerships with more than 1,500 e-commerce sites, including some of the biggest players in India, like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Ajio. The company monetizes by charging brands a commission for transactions made through CashKaro links. The commissions are also how CashKaro is able to give cash back to shoppers, which can be deposited into their bank accounts or redeemed as gift vouchers for Flipkart and Amazon. CashKaro\u2019s founders say it currently processes more than one million monthly transactions.<\/p>\n<p>CashKaro competes for the attention of online shoppers with a bevy of other coupon and cashback services in India. Some of its rivals include CouponDunia, GrabOn and GoPaisa.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are the only VC-funded cashback site in India. While capital itself is not the differentiator, it is what we have been able to do with that capital which sets us apart,&#8221; Bhargava told TechCrunch, adding that CashKaro&#8217;s cashback rates are among the highest in the market.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given that we now drive close to a half a billion dollars in GMV through CashKaro and EarnKaro to our partner sites, we are able to get higher commission rates from partner sites, which in turn helps us pass the most benefit to our members.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While COVID-19 has affected e-commerce businesses around the world because of sudden changes in consumer habits, the situation in India was particularly complicated in April and May because there were containment zones throughout the country, and <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/technology\/tech-news-technology\/lockdown-4-amazon-flipkart-ecommerce-deliver-nonessentials-red-green-orange-zones-6415154\/\">in some zones, deliveries of non-essential items were not allowed until May<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID-19 caught us by surprise and Indian e-commerce was neither prepared to handle the surge in demand, nor did we expect so many supply side and delivery issues,&#8221; said Bhargava. &#8220;Given CashKaro works with all e-commerce sites, we saw these trends as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Since June, however, sales have started to recover and is seeing growth as people continue to stay home and shop online.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our business is growing month on month and, in fact, the pandemic spurred our expansion into new digital categories, like education, gaming and online video streaming, which have seen exponential growth,&#8221; Bhargava added. Sales of electronics, home and kitchen items, personal care and beauty have also increased over the past few months.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the economic impact of the pandemic has prompted more people to seek cashback offers and other money-saving deals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are seeing that saving consciousness has gone up amongst online shoppers and people are finding services like CashKaro and EarnKaro more useful than ever before,&#8221; Bhargava said. &#8220;On the client side, our partners, such as Amazon, Myntra and Ajio, are also working with us more closely because they are seeing that our performance marketing model is the perfect way to scale while keeping profitability in mind amidst these tough times.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The new round of capital will be used for CashKaro\u2019s goal of doubling its registered member base over the next 12 months from the current 5 million. Bhargava told TechCrunch that it will expand cashback offers into categories like credit cards and education, and launch new marketing campaigns focused around events like upcoming festivals and the Indian Premier League season, which starts this weekend.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also &#8220;chasing aggressive growth for EarnKaro and reaching out to more influencers, resellers, housewives and students who are our primary target market for this product,&#8221; she added. Finally, part of the Series B will be used for hiring, including leadership positions.<\/p>\n<p>For <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/korea-investment-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"korea-investment-partners\">Korea Investment Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> one of the largest South Korean venture capital firms, CashKaro represents a chance to tap into India\u2019s fast-growing e-commerce market. In a statement, managing partner Hudson Kyung-sik Ho said, &#8220;We believe this is a highly scalable opportunity and both Swati and Rohan have set it on a truly exciting growth trajectory. CashKaro and EarnKaro together have shown exceptional unit metrics and we are really excited to be a part of India\u2019s affiliate story.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CashKaro, one of the leading cashback and coupon sites in India, will expand its range of services for e-commerce after raising $10 million in Series B funding, the New Delhi-based startup announced today.

Some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/analysts-say-tiktoks-sale-deadline-will-be-extended-51599762980\">analysts had predicted<\/a> that the deadline would be extended because of the sale&#8217;s complexity.<\/p>\n<p>Trump issued <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat\/\">an executive order last month<\/a> claiming there is &#8220;credible evidence&#8221; that ByteDance &#8220;might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.&#8221; ByteDance was already in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/02\/microsoft-pursuing-tiktok-purchase-with-september-15th-deadline-may-invite-u-s-investors-to-participate\/\">negotiations with Microsoft for a sale.<\/a> Several other large American tech companies have since reportedly entered into talks with the popular video-sharing app &#8212; but potential new roadblocks to a deal have also emerged.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Despite TikTok&#8217;s larger user base and value as one of the most popular social media apps among Gen Z, there are currently several issues that may lower its attractiveness for buyers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TJBHBVaCfD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/china-export-rules-complicate-tiktok-sale\/\">TikTok parent ByteDance says it will &#8216;strictly follow&#8217; China export controls<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TikTok parent ByteDance says it will &#8216;strictly follow&#8217; China export controls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/china-export-rules-complicate-tiktok-sale\/embed\/#?secret=TJBHBVaCfD\" data-secret=\"TJBHBVaCfD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>For example, the software code used in ByteDance\u2019s apps, including TikTok, was developed by engineers and developers at its Beijing headquarters. This makes separating TikTok from ByteDance more complicated on a technical level. Another factor is an update China made two weeks ago to export control laws that cover artificial intelligence technologies. TikTok\u2019s AI-based algorithms, which show new content to users depending on their interests and browsing history, are valuable and a huge part of its success. After the export control policy update was issued by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, ByteDance said it will &#8220;strictly follow&#8221; the new rules, but that might prevent ByteDance from including TikTok\u2019s personalized recommendation and AI-based technology in a sale, making it a less attractive acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>In addition <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/daily-crunch-microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-inches-closer-to-reality\">to Microsoft<\/a>, contenders for TikTok reportedly include other American tech heavyweights like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449\">Twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/google-weighs-acquisition-of-rival-to-video-app-tiktok-11570213344\">Google<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/08\/17\/oracle-is-in-talks-to-acquire-tiktoks-us-operations-source-says.html\">Oracle<\/a>. Walmart has even put itself forward as a buyer, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/tiktok-deal\/\">potential partnership with Microsoft<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok&#8217;s security is also under a magnifying glass in several other countries. For example, it was among a roster of Chinese apps <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/\">banned in India\u00a0 <\/a>over &#8220;national security and defence&#8221; concerns,\u201d and is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/tiktok-is-being-investigated-by-frances-data-watchdog\/\">currently being investigated<\/a> by French data security watchdog CNIL.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok has fought back against those claims. Last month, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/24\/tiktok-sues-the-u-s-government-over-its-forthcoming-ban\/\">sued the Trump administration<\/a>, stating in an <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/tiktok-files-lawsuit\">announcement on August 24 <\/a>that it &#8220;we strongly disagree with the Administration\u2019s position that TikTok is a national security threat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In its complaint, TikTok said it has taken &#8220;extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok\u2019s user data&#8221; by storing data in the U.S. and Singapore, and creating barriers between TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data and the data of other ByteDance products like Douyin.<\/p>\n<p>Since launching in 2017, TikTok, ByteDance&#8217;s international version of Douyin, has become firmly entrenched in internet culture, especially among Gen Z. In the U.S. alone, TikTok says it has more than 100 million users in the U.S. and employs about 1,500 people.<\/p>\n<p>Even though several apps, including Instagram, are trying to position themselves as TikTok alternatives with similar short-form video-sharing features, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/20\/theres-no-frontrunner-to-be-found-among-the-tiktok-alternatives\/\">no frontrunner has emerged so far<\/a>. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/sensortower.com\/blog\/top-apps-worldwide-august-2020-by-downloads\">a new report by analytics firm Sensor Tower <\/a>said that in August, TikTok was the most downloaded non-gaming app worldwide, with more than 63.3 million installs. TikTok users are so committed to the app that at least one VPN provider, ExpressVPN, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/09\/tiktok-bans-vpn-surges\/\">saw a spike in traffic after the U.S. government proposed a potential ban in July<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/tiktok-ban-us-national-security-risk\/\">cybersecurity experts say<\/a> that TikTok&#8217;s data collection practices are similar to other social media apps that depend on advertising revenue. But a major concern revolves around its ownership by a Chinese company that may be forced to capitulate to demands for data by the Chinese government. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/open-sourced\/2019\/12\/16\/21013048\/tiktok-china-national-security-investigation\">Chinese cybersecurity law<\/a> requires Chinese tech companies, like ByteDance, to comply with government requests for user data. ByteDance has said it would <a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/04\/tech\/tiktok-chinese-media-intl-hnk\/index.html\">resist attempts<\/a> by the Chinese government to access TikTok\u2019s user data.<\/p>\n<p>Security concerns about TikTok also increased after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738\">a Wall Street Journal analysis published in August<\/a> found that TikTok went around an Android operating system feature designed to limit how much data, including unique identifiers called MAC addresses, that apps can collect from users. According to the WSJ, TikTok stopped collecting unique identifiers in November, but its investigation raised questions about TikTok&#8217;s commitment to protecting user privacy. In a statement to the WSJ, TikTok said &#8220;like our peers, we constantly update our app to keep up with evolving security challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just Republicans who are taking a stance against TikTok. In July, Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign <a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2020\/07\/28\/politics\/biden-campaign-tiktok\/index.html\">reportedly asked its staff to remove TikTok <\/a>from their work and personal devices.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S government&#8217;s scrutiny of TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/24\/tiktok-lamakers-national-security-threat\/\">began escalating last year<\/a> when Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) asked Joseph Maguire, then the acting director of national intelligence, to assess if TikTok can be forced to turn over American users&#8217; data to Chinese authorities.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement emailed to TechCrunch, a TikTok spokesperson said, &#8220;TikTok is loved by 100 million Americans because it&#8217;s a home for entertainment, self-expression, and connection. We&#8217;re committed to continuing to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform for many years to come.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The United States government will not extend the September 20 deadline for Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok, President Donald Trump said on Thursday.

Ventures launches $315 million fund for US and Japanese B2B startups"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dnx.vc\/\">DNX Ventures<\/a>, an investment firm that focuses on early-stage B2B startups in Japan and the United States, announced today that it has closed a new $315 million fund. This is DNX\u2019s third flagship fund; along with supplementary annexed funds, this brings its total managed so far to $567 million.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2011, with offices in San Mateo, California and Tokyo, Japan, DNX has invested in more than 100 startups to date, and has 13 exits under its belt. The firm, a member of the <a href=\"https:\/\/drapernetwork.com\/\">Draper Venture Network<\/a>, focuses on cloud and enterprise software, cybersecurity, edge computing, sales and marketing automation, finance and retail. The companies it invests in are usually raising &#8220;seed plus&#8221; or Series A funding and DNX\u2019s typical check size ranges from $1 million to $5 million, depending on the startup\u2019s stage, managing director Q Motiwala told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>DNX isn\u2019t disclosing the names of its third fund\u2019s limited partners, but Motiwala said it includes more than 30 LPs, including financial institutions, banks and large conglomerates. DNX began working on the fund last year, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Motiwala says DNX is optimistic about the outlook for B2B startups, because past macroeconomic crises, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2001 dot-com burst, showed founders continue innovating as they figure out how to make their businesses more efficient while building urgently needed solutions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>For example, DNX has always focused on sectors like cloud computing, cybersecurity, edge computing and robotics, but the COVID-19 pandemic has made those technologies even more relevant. For example, the massive upsurge in remote work means that companies need to adapt their tech infrastructure, while robots like the ones developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/20\/robot-nurse\/\">Diligent Robotics, a DNX portfolio company<\/a>, can help hospitals cope with nursing shortages.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our overall theme has always been the digitization of traditional industries like construction, transportation or healthcare, and we\u2019ve always been interested in how to make the reach to the customer much better, so sales and marketing automation, for example,&#8221; said Motiwala. &#8220;Then the last piece of this is, how do you make society or businesses function better through automation, and those might take things like robotics and other technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The differences and similarities between U.S. and Japanese B2B startups<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2042489\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2042489\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2042489\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg\" alt=\"A graphic featuring DNX Ventures' team members\" width=\"500\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg 1900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DNX.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2042489\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A graphic featuring <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/dnx-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"dnx-ventures\">DNX Ventures&#8217; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> team members (Image Credits: DNX Ventures)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons DNX was founded nine years ago was because &#8220;Japan has very strong spending on enterprise,&#8221; Motiwala said. The firm launched with offices in the U.S. and Japan and has continued to focus on B2B while growing the size of its funds. The firm\u2019s debut fund was $40 million and its second one, announced in 2016, was more than $170 million. Motiwala said the $315 million DNX raised for its third fund was more than the firm expected.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. B2B startups tend to think about global expansion at an earlier stage than their Japanese counterparts, but that has started to change, he said, and many Japanese B2B companies launch with an eye on expanding into different countries. Instead of the U.S. or Europe, however, they tend to focus on Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, or Taiwan. Another difference is that U.S. startups make heavier initial investments in their technology or IP, while in Japan, companies focus on getting to revenue and breaking even earlier. Motiwala said this might be because the Japanese venture capital ecosystem is smaller than in the U.S., but that attitude is also changing.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of DNX portfolio companies that have successfully entered new countries include Cylance, a U.S. company that develops antivirus software using machine learning and predictive math modeling to protect devices from malware. DNX helped Cylance establish operations in Europe and Japan. On the Japan side, software testing company Shift, an investment from DNX\u2019s first fund, has done &#8220;phenomenally well&#8221; in Southeast Asia, Motiwala said.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of going global, DNX doesn\u2019t push its portfolio companies, but encourages them to expand when the timing is right, especially if a U.S. startup wants to enter Japan, or vice versa. &#8220;We like to use the fact that we have teams in both regions. What we\u2019ve seen more is the U.S. companies entering channel partnerships for Japanese distribution,&#8221; Motiwala said. &#8220;It has been more difficult to show the same thing to Japanese companies, but at the same time what we\u2019ve realized is that instead of saying they should come into the U.S., they\u2019ve done amazing stuff going into the Philippines or Singapore.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DNX Ventures, an investment firm that focuses on early-stage B2B startups in Japan and the United States, announced today that it has closed a new $315 million fund.

Instead, many rely on digital wallets or mobile money accounts to make or receive online payments.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company now operates in about 100 countries, up from 40 when TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/05\/thunes-raises-10m\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">covered its $10 million Series A<\/a> in May 2019. The latest round will be used to grow its operations across Africa, Asia and Latin America, and brings Thunes\u2019 total raised so far to $70 million.<\/p>\n<p>Headquartered in Singapore, Thunes also has offices in London, Shanghai, New York, Dubai and Nairobi. Chief executive officer Peter De Caluwe told TechCrunch that Thunes looked for active investors who could help it work with banks and regulators in new markets, and help them connect with potential clients. Part of its Series B round will be used to hire teams in countries in which it wants to enter or expand its operations, including Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHaving Helios, who know many of the regulators and players already in Africa, will allow us to grow faster and get introductions,\u201d said De Caluwe. \u201cGGV did the same for us in China, because GGV is well-established in China and the [San Francisco] Bay Area.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In an email to TechCrunch, Helios Investment Partners co-founder and managing partner Tope Lawani said the firm focuses on fintech, especially payments, in Africa, and backed Thunes because it is building important financial infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Its other investments include online payment platform Fawry, which recently went public on the Egyptian Stock Exchange.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cross-border payments represents a significant market opportunity globally given increasing cross border trade and globalization; yet, across several emerging markets, fragmented and complex payment ecosystems often leave businesses and consumers struggling with slow, costly and unreliable ways of moving money,&#8221; Lawani said. &#8220;Thunes\u2019 unique platform which was set up to address these pain points by providing accessible, fast and reliable payment solutions stood out to us as a company very well positioned to capture this growth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2042427\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2042427\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2042427\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg\" alt=\"Peter De Caluwe, the chief executive officer of cross-borders payment network Thunes\" width=\"390\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg 3264w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=768,1160 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=450,680 450w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=1017,1536 1017w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=1356,2048 1356w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Peter-against-a-building.jpg?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2042427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peter De Caluwe, chief executive officer of cross-border payments network Thunes<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Pulling together a fragmented ecosystem<\/h2>\n<p>Similarly to how the SWIFT system connects traditional banks, Thunes\u2019 cross-border payments network makes it easier to transfer money online to recipients in different countries, even if they use different financial services, by serving as a hub for financial institutions, digital wallets and other payment systems.<\/p>\n<p>De Caluwe said Thunes divides its markets\u2019 needs into four categories. The first are countries that are primarily cash-driven, like the Philippines. The second are places where there is a dominant digital wallet, like MPesa in Kenya (one of Thunes\u2019 clients). Then there are countries like Indonesia, where there are a host of new financial instruments, like GrabPay or GoPay. Finally, Thunes also serves banks that usually work with businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNobody really connects all these players together. It might sound very logical to do that, but it\u2019s almost like building an infrastructure, making sure there are pipes, tunnels or whatever you want to call it, going between a wallet in Africa, a bank in China or accounting in Southeast Asia,\u201d said De Caluwe.<\/p>\n<p>SWIFT (or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), founded in 1973, revolutionized the financial industry by connecting banks through a standardized messaging system. This is what enables people to deposit checks from another bank into their accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Thunes wants to do the same thing with digital financial services in emerging markets. \u201cAll of these e-wallets, bank accounts, mobile money accounts, we plug them into our central platform, so they become interoperable, which means that you can easily transfer money from one country to another country over our network,\u201d De Caluwe said.<\/p>\n<p>Thunes\u2019 market opportunity is massive: Based on data from a strategic workshop it conducted with financial research firm EY, about $45 trillion flows between the countries in which Thunes operates. That amount includes many different kinds of transactions, but Thunes is taking a focused approach to which ones it handles, with APIs designed for specific use cases.<\/p>\n<p>The first example De Caluwe gave is for remittance companies, including MoneyGram, Western Union and Remitly (all Thunes clients), to move money into digital wallets and bank accounts. Another API was developed for processing large amounts of payments and is used by clients like VIA, a region-wide mobile wallet alliance launched by Singtel Group, the Singapore-based telecommunications conglomerate. Thunes\u2019 technology allows people to make payments from their VIA wallets in different currencies and countries. A major part of Thunes\u2019 business is also its B2B solutions, designed for cross-border trade, which allows companies in different countries to transfer money directly into each other\u2019s bank accounts without needing to deal with a maze of interbank connections and long wait times.<\/p>\n<h2>How Thunes&#8217; technology helps<\/h2>\n<p>Part of Thunes\u2019 Series B is earmarked for product development, specifically technology that will enable more collections from countries. De Caluwe explained that so far, most of Thunes\u2019 solutions have focused on moving money <em>into<\/em> its markets. A potential use case for collections are Chinese retailers who sell to customers in African countries. Thunes\u2019 new solution will allow them to collect payments directly from a digital wallet like MPesa, while making it easier for people to make payments on sites that don\u2019t accept digital wallets or mobile money accounts. To serve those customers, Thunes is also working on digital bank accounts, which it has already begun piloting in Indonesia. Users are able to deposit cash into their digital bank accounts at ATMs, and then use those funds for online payments.<\/p>\n<p>Other noteworthy Thunes clients include Grab, which uses its real-time payment system to make daily transfers to drivers\u2019 digital wallets, bank accounts or cash pick-up locations, and the National Bank of Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional methods of sending money across international borders are time-consuming and expensive, and there are many financial tech companies looking to solve some of those pain points. Some of the best-known are TransferWise, Revolut and Payoneer.<\/p>\n<p>Thunes differentiates by focusing almost exclusively on emerging markets, where the barriers to entry are high. TransferWise theoretically is a competitor, but it doesn\u2019t serve as many markets as Thunes, and is also a potential client for Thunes\u2019 technology, De Caluwe said.<\/p>\n<p>Thunes does compete with regional digital payment hubs, but De Caluwe said the market opportunity is so vast he\u2019d be \u201chappy to share that $45 trillion with many players, because even if we could get one or two percent of that, we would already be a very larger business.\u201d He added, \u201cthe market is so large and the systems that are currently used are broken or not helpful because many consumers can\u2019t even get access to it since they don\u2019t have a bank accounts, they only have a digital wallet or mobile money account.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One advantage of Thunes\u2019 technology is that it significantly reduces the amount of transaction fees consumers or businesses need to pay. The company makes revenue by charging a fixed transaction fee between two cents to $2, depending on the destination country.
