He has written over 2,500 articles on technology and tech startups and has established himself as an influential voice on the European tech scene. He has a deep background in startups, privacy, blockchain, security, fintech, mobile, social and media.

With eight years of experience at TechCrunch, he’s one of the familiar faces of the tech publication that obsessively covers Silicon Valley and the tech industry. In fact, his career started at TechCrunch when he was 21. Based in Paris, many people in the tech ecosystem consider him as the most knowledgeable tech journalist in town.

Romain likes to spot important startups before anyone else. He was the first person to cover N26, Revolut and DigitalOcean. He has written scoops on large acquisitions from Apple, Microsoft and Snap.

When he’s not writing, Romain is also a developer — he understands how the tech behind the tech works. He also has a deep historical knowledge of the computer industry for the past 50 years. He knows how to connect the dots between innovations and the effect on the fabric of our society.

Romain graduated from Emlyon Business School, a leading French business school specialized in entrepreneurship. He has helped several non-profit organizations, such as StartHer, an organization that promotes education and empowerment of women in technology, and Techfugees, an organization that empowers displaced people with technology." />

vape companies are experiencing a sales boom during the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global pandemic is driving interest toward cannabis, and device makers are recording record sales. From startups to major players, several leading manufacturers told TechCrunch that their companies are seeing a boom in sales since the start of the crisis. Coupled with supply constraints, consumers are now seeing limited supply on some top models as makers try to keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some company CEOs see the pandemic driving consumer acceptance and pushing legalization at the national level. With legalization, new consumers enter the market, and companies such as Canopy Growth, PAX and Grenco Science look to benefit as makers of some of the best vaporizers on the market \u2014 that is if consumers can find them in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supply chain issues are partly to blame, and cannabis products are not alone in facing short supply. For the U.S.-market, many products, from bicycles to kayaks, are hard to find right now. And like those products, increased demand is straining the already stressed supply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grenco Science was founded in 2012 and was an early mover in the dry herb vaporizer market. In 2019, the company raised a Series A for an undisclosed amount to develop and release innovative products. And in early 2020, the company was ready to launch the inexpensive Dash and the Roam, a portable water-filtered concentrate vaporizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Then COVID-19 hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CEO and co-founder Chris Folkerts says product launches were pushed back, yet the company was still able to launch the Roam and Dash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been able to see growth and expand the product pipeline significantly,&#8221; Folkerts said. &#8220;There are still releases slated for later this year and we&#8217;ll be able to launch the redesigned Stundenglass after the company&#8217;s acquisition.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indeed, Grenco had a busy pandemic, launching two new products and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/01\/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee\/\">acquiring the maker of another<\/a>. And they&#8217;re not done. Folkerts says interest in dry herb vaporizers is spiking and could be due to the Dash vape launch. Grenco has three more new dry herb vaporizers in its release pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Folkerts admits that there were troubles along the way, primarily around customer support and shipping products. The company saw an influx of orders through online sales and distributors that the company was not prepared to handle. He says the company had to repurpose &#8220;a decent portion&#8221; of its staff to speak directly to online consumers to address product and shipping concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s marquee vaporizer company Storz &amp; Bickel is also experiencing increased customer support issues. Browse any user forum and it&#8217;s clear the company cannot keep up with customer relations. Buyers are reporting delayed shipping and inconsistent customer support. Most items on <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"http:\/\/storz-bickel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">storz-bickel.com<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> carry a &#8220;low inventory&#8221; warning, though most are available through official distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Andy Lytwynec, VP, Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, says Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s sudden growth is outpacing forecasts, and the company accelerated production expansion. Thirty new employees were added to its German factory through a heightened sense of urgency, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2000, Storz &amp; Bickel released the Volcano, arguable the first worthwhile desktop dry herb vaporizer. The company now sells two versions of the Volcano and a handful of handheld devices that use the same underlying technology, all of which are certified for medical use. In 2018, Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel, where it joined the conglomerate&#8217;s other vaporizer brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lytwynec points to Storz &amp; Bickle as a barometer of sorts in judging the impact of COVID-19. The German-based vaporizer company saw an uptick in sales, as reported in Canopy Growth&#8217;s latest quarterly report. The company reported a 71% increase during the first quarter ending on June 30. The financial report pointed to Storz &amp; Bickel&#8217;s increased sales and distribution expansion as a primary reason for the increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the pandemic, consumers are not just turning to dry herbs. Makers of concentrate vaporizers also see an increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Puffco, maker of the fantastic Puffco Peak e-rig, tells TechCrunch it has also seen an explosion in sales. Puffco founder Roger Volodarsky says, &#8220;Since the pandemic hit, it seems like many new users have joined the cannabis space. Puffco has seen historic sales during this time. We&#8217;re thankful to see our growth continue despite the challenges that we&#8217;ve been faced with.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of using ground flower, Puffco&#8217;s products are designed to be used with concentrates, which many see as the next big cannabis inhalation market. It sits between dried flower and portable so-called vape pens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jupiter Research is the largest distributor of CCELL vaporization hardware and sells into all regulated cannabis markets globally, including across the United States. For this market, namely the pre-packaged, self-contained THC cartridges, Jupiter Research has seen little effect from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a material increase or decrease in the vape market as a whole due to COVID-19,&#8221; Tim Conder, COO and president said, adding, &#8220;at least from what our data tells us. In fact, Jupiter has continued to gain market share in the vape category as a whole. Vape remains the second largest category in cannabis henna flour. The third is edibles.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conder sees COVID-19 potentially changing the government&#8217;s stance on cannabis. As he told TechCrunch, it feels like cannabis legalization is gaining more traction at a federal level. He hopes state and federal governments are looking at the fiscal benefits of a nationwide legal cannabis market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other cannabis hardware manufacturers agree COVID-19 is pushing the United States government to look at cannabis through a different light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DynaVap, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, says the public perception of cannabis has remained consistent with continual movement into positive public acceptance. Eric Olson, founder, and CFO of DynaVap, notes that he feels the cannabis plant has even had positive effects and eases the impact from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;The post-pandemic outlook for the cannabis plant will be an impactful positive public movement assuming the industry can continue the legalization momentum on the federal and state levels in the U.S.,&#8221; Olson told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DyanVap, which employs 50 people in Wisconsin, says it started increasing staffing in May and recently launched several new products, including a portable induction heater called &#8220;the Orion.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, six months out from the start of the global crisis, the cannabis market seems to have gained significant traction as such manufacturers have ramped up production and increased staffing to keep up with demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Canopy Growth&#8217;s Lytwynec sees the past few months as a turning point around cannabis. And not just for the economic impact for legalization (and taxing) cannabis. He says he sees consumers waking up to the level of sophistication around cannabis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;People are spending their dollars, not on baggies of illicit weed, but they&#8217;re spending their money on higher-end products, and it&#8217;s nice to see the category mature in the middle of a pandemic. We see people investing in [devices] and the quality of consumables.

This has proven useful in the medical field, where early indications of serious conditions can be spotted with enough confidence to recommend further testing.<\/p>\n<p>This arthritis detection model looks at X-rays, same as doctors who do that kind of work. But by the time it&#8217;s visible to human perception, the damage is already done. A long-running project tracking thousands of people for seven years made for a great training set, making the nearly imperceptible early signs of osteoarthritis visible to the AI model, which predicted it with 78% accuracy three years out.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that knowing early doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can be avoided, as there&#8217;s no effective treatment. But that knowledge can be put to other uses \u2014 for example, much more effective testing of <em>potential<\/em> treatments. &#8220;Instead of recruiting 10,000 people and following them for 10 years, we can just enroll 50 people who we know are going to be getting osteoarthritis \u2026 Then we can give them the experimental drug and see whether it stops the disease from developing,&#8221; said co-author Kenneth Urish. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2020\/09\/15\/1917405117\">The study appeared in PNAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using acoustic monitoring to preemptively save the whales<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that ships still collide with and kill large whales on a regular basis, but it&#8217;s true.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion. The service, now available to Prime members, is an expansion of the existing <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/personalshopper\">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe<\/a>, a $4.99 per month Stitch Fix rival, originally aimed at women. With Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, an Amazon stylist selects an assortment of fashion items that match a customer&#8217;s style and fit preferences. These are then shipped to the customer on a monthly basis for home try-on. Whatever the customer doesn&#8217;t want to keep can be returned using the resealable package and the prepaid shipping label provided.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the new men&#8217;s personal shopping service will include brands like Scotch &amp; Soda, Original Penguin, Adidas, Lacoste, Carhartt, Levi\u2019s, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and more &#8212; a mix of both Amazon&#8217;s own in-house brands and others. In total, Amazon says Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe will offer hundreds of thousands of men&#8217;s styles across more than a thousand different brands.<\/p>\n<p>The service itself is similar in many ways to Stitch Fix, as it also starts customers with a style quiz to personalize their monthly fashion selections. Also like competitive fashion subscription services, customers can reach out to their stylist with specific requests &#8212; like if they need a professional outfit for a job interview, for example, or some other occasion where they may want something outside their usual interests.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But unlike Stitch Fix, which charges a $20 &#8220;stylist fee&#8221; which is later credited toward any items you choose to keep, Amazon&#8217;s personal shopping service is a flat $4.99 per month. Another difference is that the Personal Shopper service will alert you ahead of your shipment to review their picks. You then choose the up to eight items you want to receive, instead of waiting for the surprise of opening your box.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2052906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2052906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg 932w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-5.32.05-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2052906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before today, Amazon had offered men&#8217;s fashion in its try-before-you-buy Prime Wardrobe product selection. But that service simply allows Amazon Prime members to request certain fashion items for home try-on, instead of paying for them upfront then returning what doesn&#8217;t work. To date, Prime Wardrobe&#8217;s biggest drawback has been that many of the fashion items found on Amazon aren&#8217;t eligible for home try-on, particularly many of those from the most in-demand brands.<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon claims it doesn&#8217;t stuff Prime Wardrobe with only its own brands. The company says less than 1% of its total selection of brands within Prime Wardrobe are Amazon-owned. (Of course, that percentage may be higher in the boxes customers receive from their personal shopper, at times.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also says millions of customers have used the home try-on option provided by Prime Wardrobe and\u00a0 \u00a0&#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have created fashion profiles within Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe since its 2019 launch.<\/p>\n<p>However, only &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers today use the Personal Shopper service on a monthly basis.<\/p>\n<p>That means Prime Wardrobe is no real threat to Stitch Fix at this time, if making a comparison purely based on number of paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>StitchFix has had longer to perfect its model and refine its insights, which has allowed it to grow its active client base to 3.5 million. That figure is up 9% year-over-year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/09\/22\/stitch-fix-sfix-earnings-q4-2020.html\">as of the company&#8217;s latest earnings<\/a> reported earlier this month. More recently, Stitch Fix benefited from the pandemic &#8212; after it got through its initial backlogged orders &#8212; as customers sought to change their style from businesswear to activewear.<\/p>\n<p>Men&#8217;s activewear had been particularly in demand, which is perhaps a trend Amazon had also seen ahead of the launch of its new service.<\/p>\n<p>While home try-on via Prime Wardrobe is available today in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, the Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe subscription is currently available in the U.S. only. It&#8217;s also only available on mobile devices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is introducing a personal shopping service for men&#8217;s fashion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases. While the more detailed language doesn&#8217;t actually change the earlier policy&#8217;s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don&#8217;t currently use Google Play&#8217;s billing system when selling digital goods in their app. In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play&#8217;s billing library. That means there&#8217;s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<p>To make the transition easier, app developers will be given an extended 1-year grace period to introduce Google Play&#8217;s billing library into their apps, had they previously skirted Google&#8217;s policies around digital purchases.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google will also give some businesses impacted by the pandemic the ability to opt-out of its payment policies for the next 12 months. This could apply to those businesses that had to move their previously physical services online &#8212; such as live events.<\/p>\n<p>Apple recently did the same for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/25\/facebook-vs-apple-revisited\/\">Facebook&#8217;s paid events business on the iOS App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Apple, Google collects a 30% commission on in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MFmoNDQvrFk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Google also said it won&#8217;t limit developers&#8217; ability to communicate with customers, including about alternative ways to pay &#8212; in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-approves-hey-bug-fix-update-after-basecamp-agrees-to-tweak-app-at-center-of-store-policy-spat\/\">stark<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/22\/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update\/\">contrast<\/a> with Apple.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer\u2019s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play,&#8221; the company noted. &#8220;We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly,&#8221; it <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bloomberg had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-25\/google-to-increase-push-for-apps-to-give-cut-of-in-app-purchases\">previously reported<\/a> Google was planning to increase its push for a cut of Play Store apps&#8217; in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The policy updates indicate how Google is responding to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its Android mobile platform and how it operates its app store, Google Play. These matters have recently been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/tech-antitrust-hearing\/\">the subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S<\/a>. and other markets, where governments are attempting to determine if the current crop of tech giants have been abusing their power by way of anti-competitive business practices.<\/p>\n<p>At issue is the fact that app stores have become the default way &#8212; and in some cases, the only possible way &#8212; for developers to distribute apps to mobile consumers. But these app stores also commission many of the apps they distribute, even when the platform maker itself offers a competing product. For example, the stores distribute alternative music streaming services, like Spotify, and take a cut of its subscription revenues. At the same time, they also offer their own music streaming service, like Apple Music or Google&#8217;s YouTube Music.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, larger app publishers like Epic Games don&#8217;t want to pay app stores for distribution and billing services, as they&#8217;re capable of providing the platform and tools for distribution and can bill their customers directly. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic has engaged in a lawsuit<\/a> over the matter which is still ongoing. A group of developers, including Epic, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness\/\">also last week launched a coalition<\/a> to demand more &#8220;fairness&#8221; in the app industry and to fight back against what they perceive to be app stores&#8217; overreach.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s app store business hasn&#8217;t received quite the same level of attention as Apple&#8217;s because it already offers users the ability to sideload apps. That means users can toggle a setting to install apps hosted outside of the Google Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/09\/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">announcement<\/a> today, Google also says it will make changes in next year&#8217;s release of Android 12 that will make it easier for consumers to use other app stores on Android devices, without compromising Android&#8217;s existing safety measures. Google hasn&#8217;t said what these changes may include, but one area of concern has been how the Android OS approaches the messaging around sideloading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it presents the option as only a serious security risk that users must manually enable. More recently, it <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/03\/18\/google-advanced-protection-android\/\">limited sideloading in its Advanced Protection Program<\/a>, which is designed for high-profile Google users, like politicians or public figures, or those whose accounts could be targeted by hackers, like journalists or political dissidents.<\/p>\n<p>That means reasonably safe alternatives to Google Play have more difficulty acquiring users.<\/p>\n<p>The company said the changes related to third-party app stores were directed by developer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Google stressed, too, that its policies are applied universally, even to its own apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google\u2019s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they&#8217;re third-party apps or our own apps,&#8221; the company said, in an announcement. &#8220;In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google\u2019s competitors in our Editors&#8217; Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google&#8217;s own apps,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under threat of regulation, Google announced today it&#8217;s updating its Google Play billing policies to better clarify which types of transactions will be subject to Google&#8217;s commissions on in-app purchases.

Behind the scene, Multis is a multisignature Ethereum wallet. The company doesn\u2019t control the keys, which means Multis can\u2019t access your funds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a regulatory point of view, it\u2019s been very useful because we don\u2019t hold assets and we can\u2019t review and block transactions,\u201d Sahaghian said.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the multisignature design, you can create an approval workflow so that each transaction needs to be approved by a certain number of people on the team.<\/p>\n<p>Multis supports Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, which means you can also use stablecoins, such as USDC and DAI. This way, you\u2019re not exposed to cryptocurrency volatility when you choose to keep all your assets in USDC for instance. You can swap tokens from Multis directly.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have assets in your Multis account, you can issue payments to employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, etc. You can save addresses and other relevant information to streamline payments in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Centralizing all your crypto transactions on Multi can be useful when you need to file your taxes. You can export all your transactions and hand them over to your accountant.<\/p>\n<p>And if you have too many assets on your hands, you can invest some assets and earn interests thanks to DeFi products. The company uses <a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\">Compound<\/a> for that feature.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, Multis clients are mostly companies working on blockchain products, generating revenue in cryptocurrencies or paying people using stablecoins. But the company wants to simplify its product by adding EUR and USD accounts with cards and IBANs.<\/p>\n<p>Multis could act as a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Companies with offices in multiple countries could use it to save money on intercompany fees. The startup is still working on those new features, but it could lead to some interesting use cases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Q6uPQlDdo9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/\">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/embed\/#?secret=Q6uPQlDdo9\" data-secret=\"Q6uPQlDdo9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Multis, a French startup that is building business bank accounts, except that it lets you store, send and receive cryptocurrencies.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/klaxoon-teases-new-interactive-meeting-product-for-video-calls\/\">teasing<\/a> its new product, French startup <a href=\"https:\/\/klaxoon.com\">Klaxoon<\/a> is launching Board, a visual interface that lets you work together during a video call. Instead of staring at other people\u2019s faces, you get a shared canvas that you can use for presentations and to suggest ideas.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/klaxoon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"klaxoon\">Klaxoon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is well aware that many companies have strong opinions about video conferencing services. Some companies are already using Microsoft Teams for everything, others are using Zoom or Google Meet. That\u2019s why the company is trying to make it as easy as possible to use Board while you\u2019re on a call using Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Google Meet.<\/p>\n<p>Given that you\u2019re already in Board when you\u2019re generating a Zoom link, you can also use Klaxoon\u2019s own video-conferencing service called Live.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cVideo represents less than 10% of your screen real estate. Our goal isn\u2019t to compete with other services when it comes to pixels, high definition or the number of thumbnails,\u201d Klaxoon co-founder and CEO Matthieu Beucher told me.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, when you use Live, you accept multiple constraints that could help you remain focused on your meeting. For instance, you can only have 15 people in your meeting. The person organizing the meeting can set a limit \u2014 it can be five minutes, 15 minutes or 30 minutes. But you can\u2019t use Live for a meeting that lasts longer than 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, other people on the calls are represented through tiny thumbnails on the right side of the screen. Most of the screen is filled with a sort of digital whiteboard that you can use to write text, insert images or videos. You can work on your board before starting the meeting or you can add a table from a template library.<\/p>\n<p>People joining your meeting can submit ideas through digital sticky notes. You can also switch from the freeform view to a more structured column view to move ideas from one category to another.<\/p>\n<p>Klaxoon has been working on interactive whiteboards and meeting tools for quite a few years now. Board combines some of the stuff that the company is already providing to its clients, but with a focus on remote meetings. The service is launching today for \u20ac9.90 per month.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2051587\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2051587\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2051587\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Klaxon-board_board-3views-1920.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2051587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Klaxoon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few weeks after teasing its new product, French startup Klaxoon is launching Board, a visual interface that lets you work together during a video call.

Instead of having one seller selling to many customers, marketplaces let you sell products from many sellers to many customers. Mirakl has built a solution to manage the marketplace of your e-commerce platform.<\/p>\n<p>300 companies have been working with Mirakl for their marketplace, such as Best Buy Canada, Carrefour, Darty and Office Depot. More recently, Mirakl has been increasingly working with B2B clients as well.<\/p>\n<p>These industry-specific marketplaces can be used for procurement or bulk selling of parts. In this category, clients include Airbus Helicopters, Toyota Material Handling and Accor\u2019s Astore. 60% of Mirakl\u2019s marketplace are still consumer-facing marketplaces, but the company is adding as many B2B and B2C marketplaces these days.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a lot of features that enable platform business models that go further than simple marketplaces,\u201d co-founder and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/philippe-corrot\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"philippe-corrot\">Philippe Corrot <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told me. \u201cFor instance, we\u2019ve invested in services \u2014 it lets our clients develop service platforms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In France, Conforama can upsell customers with different services when they buy some furniture for instance. Mirakl has also launched its own catalog manager so that you can merge listings, add information, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The company is using artificial intelligence to do the heavy-lifting on this front. There are other AI-enabled features, such as fraud detection.<\/p>\n<p>Given that Mirakl is a marketplace expert, it\u2019s not surprising that the company has also created a sort of marketplace of marketplaces with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirakl.com\/mirakl-connect\/\">Mirakl Connect<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMirakl Connect is a platform that is going to be the single entry point for everybody in the marketplace ecosystem, from sellers to operators and partners,\u201d Corrot said.<\/p>\n<p>For sellers, it\u2019s quite obvious. You can create a company profile and promote products on multiple marketplaces at once. But the company is also starting to work with payment service providers, fulfillment companies, feed aggregators and other partners. The company wants to become a one-stop shop on marketplaces with those partners.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Mirakl-powered marketplaces have generated $1.2 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the first half of 2020. It represents a 111% year-over-year increase, despite the economic crisis.<\/p>\n<p>With today\u2019s funding round, the company plans to expand across all areas \u2014 same features, same business model, but with more resources.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"checkout-com\">Checkout.com <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has kept a low profile for many years, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/checkout-com-the-uk-payments-startup-raises-another-150m-now-valued-at-5-5b\/\">raised $380 million<\/a> within a year and reached an impressive valuation of $5.5 billion. It wants to build a one-stop shop for all things related to payments, such as accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that it sounds a bit like Stripe. In an interview at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/\">TechCrunch Disrupt<\/a>, I asked founder and CEO Guillaume Pousaz what makes Checkout.com different from Stripe, Adyen and other companies in the payment space. It comes down to a very different philosophy when it comes to product and market approach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe only do enterprise. We really only work with the big merchants. There are a few exceptions here and there but it\u2019s mostly enterprise-only and it\u2019s purely online,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI once met [Stripe CEO] <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/patrick-collison\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"patrick-collison\">Patrick Collison <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and I joked with him. I said &#8216;you might have a million merchants, I have 1,200 merchants but I know every single one by name and they all process tens of millions every year.&#8217; So I think it\u2019s just a different business,\u201d he added later in the interview.<\/p>\n<p>Checkout.com now has a ton of money sitting in its bank account, but it has been a long and slow journey to reach that level. The company has been around for many years and reached profitability in 2012. It has been spending very meticulously over the years.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\t<div class=\"embed breakout\" id=\"vidible_div_0\" data-pid=\"56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a\" data-bcid=\"564f313b67b6231408bc51ee\" data-video=\"5f5c0f26ae62e42c37634fc4\"><\/div>\n\t\t<span><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/features\/shortcodes\/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0\"><\/script><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n<p>When talking about the early days of the company, Pousaz said the team grew really slowly. \u201cWe can hire one employee this month. Now we can hire two employees this month,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company still tries to remain as lean as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of discipline. All these companies, they raise a lot of money, they spend a lot of money and I don\u2019t challenge that model. For us, embedding that discipline and frugality in the company in how we run it is something that was important to us,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with spending. Just make sure that when you\u2019re spending, you\u2019re wise about it. You just don\u2019t spray and pray. You see this unfortunately too much with tech companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Checkout.com mostly invests in its own product. Nearly two-thirds of the company is working in product, IT and engineering. Only 13% of the company is working in sales, which is much less than some of its competitors.<\/p>\n<p>But why did Checkout.com raise hundreds of millions of dollars then? \u201cAt some point, you need validation. And the validation was really important for us. When you have Insight, DST, Coatue, GIC, Blossom it changes your dimension,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>When talking about regulators, Checkout.com has licenses in Brazil, the U.K. and France (for contingency), Hong Kong, Singapore, etc. It\u2019s a never-ending process as the company is still working on licenses in other key markets, such as Japan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese regulators are super thorough. You don\u2019t pass because you\u2019re a nice guy, you pass because you have the right processes,\u201d Pousaz said.<\/p>\n<p>I challenged that notion and mentioned the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wirecard_scandal\">Wirecard collapse<\/a>. He obviously thinks that Wirecard and Checkout.com are in a different position right now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll my money is sitting with JP Morgan, it\u2019s pretty simple. There\u2019s no bank account in the Philippines and funny stuff,\u201d Pousaz said. \u201cThe Wirecard story is so big that the real question is \u2014 go and ask the question to the auditors. Because the auditors that I have, which for the record is PwC, ask me to show them the bank statements and everything. And they are super thorough, it\u2019s a super long process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow did the Wirecard story happen? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While Checkout.com has kept a low profile for many years, the company raised $380 million within a year and reached an impressive valuation of $5.5 billion.

But if you\u2019re just entering the job market, you may end up with reliable income and a low limit on your credit card. <a href=\"https:\/\/x1creditcard.com\">X1 Card<\/a> wants to solve that by setting limits based on your current and future income instead of your credit score.<\/p>\n<p>The company says some customers can expect limits up to five times higher than what they would get from a traditional credit card. And that limit can move up if you get a promotion at your job, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe consumer credit card industry has been almost untouched by tech and has relied on the archaic credit score system. Max [Levchin], David [Sacks] and I have similar scores \u2014 that makes no sense!\u201d co-founder Deepak Rao told me. \u201cWe reimagined the credit card from the ground up to have smarter limits, intelligent features, modern rewards and a new look.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Depending on your creditworthiness, you\u2019ll get a variable APR of 12.9 to 19.9% and a balance transfer fee of 2%.

There are some fees, but it can be helpful if you\u2019re signing a new lease and you don\u2019t have any money on your bank account, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Thrive has raised $10.25 million in funding from PayPal and Affirm founder Max Levchin, former Twitter COO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/adam-bain\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"adam-bain\">Adam Bain, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Craft Ventures general partner David Sacks and others.

It helps you track your subscriptions in different ways. First, you can cancel your subscription payments from the app. If you\u2019re trying out a new service and they require you to enter your credit card information to start a free trial, you can also generate an auto-expiring virtual credit card.<\/p>\n<p>If you receive a refund, X1 Card sends you a notification. You can also attach receipts to your transaction in the app.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to rewards, X1 Card uses points. You get 2x points on all purchases by default \u2014 there&#8217;s no category or retailers that give you special rewards. If you spend more than $15,000 using the card in a year, you get 3X points. If you refer a friend, you get 4X points on your purchases for a month \u2014 each new referral adds an extra month with 4X points. Points can be redeemed at retail partners, such as Apple, Airbnb, Delta, Everlane, etc.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a credit card. But what makes this product more interesting than your average Chase-branded card is that it wants to disrupt the credit score system.

href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios-14\/\">iOS 14<\/a>, the next major version of the operating system for the iPhone. It is a free download and it works with the iPhone 6s or later, both generations of iPhone SE and the most recent iPod touch model. If your device runs iOS 13, it supports iOS 14. The update may or may not be immediately available, but keep checking because people are now receiving the update.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also releasing major updates for the iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV today. So you can expect some new features with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ipados\/ipados-14\/\">iPadOS 14<\/a>, tvOS 14 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/watchos\/watchos-7\/\">watchOS 7<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>The release of those updates <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/apple-burns-developer-goodwill-with-surprise-release-of-ios-14\/\">caught many developers by surprise<\/a>. Apple announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/apple-ios-14-release\/\">yesterday<\/a> that iOS 14 would be ready for prime time today. Usually, the company announces the release date a week or two in advance. This way, developers have enough time to fix the last remaining bugs and submit updates to the App Store.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If you update your iPhone today, don\u2019t be surprised if you encounter a few bugs here and there from third-party apps. There are some major changes under the hood and nobody expected such a short turnaround.<\/p>\n<p>The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device into iTunes for a wired update. But first, back up your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tapping on your account information at the top and then on your device name. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device into your computer to do a manual backup in iTunes (or do both, really).<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to encrypt your backup in iTunes. It is much safer if somebody hacks your computer. And encrypted backups include saved passwords and health data. This way, you don\u2019t have to reconnect to all your online accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Once this is done, you should go to the Settings app, then \u2018General\u2019 and then \u2018Software Update.\u2019 Then you should see \u2018Update Requested\u2026\u2019 It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest change of iOS 14 is the introduction of widgets on the home screen, a new App Library to browse all your apps and the ability to run App Clips \u2014 those are mini apps that feature a small part of an app and that you can run without installing anything.<\/p>\n<p>There are also many refinements across the board, such as new features for Messages, with a big focus on groups with @-mentions and replies, a new Translate app that works on your device, cycling directions in Apple Maps in some cities and various improvements in Notes, Reminders, Weather, Home and more.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about iOS 14, I looked at some of the features in the new version earlier this summer:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lDX6ZwToht\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/ios-14-gets-rid-of-the-app-grid-to-help-you-find-the-app-youre-looking-for\/\">iOS 14 gets rid of the app grid to help you find the app you&#8217;re looking for<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;iOS 14 gets rid of the app grid to help you find the app you&#8217;re looking for&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/ios-14-gets-rid-of-the-app-grid-to-help-you-find-the-app-youre-looking-for\/embed\/#?secret=lDX6ZwToht\" data-secret=\"lDX6ZwToht\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple has just released the final version of iOS 14, the next major version of the operating system for the iPhone.

Banks tell you to come to a branch to open an account even though many families only have one car and taking the bus can be a hassle. Banks have overly confusing products and don\u2019t invest in marketing channels for women.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s for all those reasons that we thought we need a fully digital solution that is branchless,\u201d Smith said. &#8220;We have no minimum balance requirement; all you need is a government-issued ID and you can sign up in three or four minutes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Jefa launches in a few months, opening an account will be free.

is a video game focused on education founded by Shadow founder"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meet <a href=\"https:\/\/powerz.tech\">PowerZ<\/a>, a new French startup founded by Emmanuel Freund, the founder of popular cloud gaming service <a href=\"https:\/\/shadow.tech\">Shadow<\/a>, as well as former Shadow employees. The company wants to develop a video game that is as engaging as Fortnite, but with a focus on education. It is both an edtech startup and a video game studio.<\/p>\n<p>PowerZ has raised a $3.5 million (\u20ac3 million) seed round from Educapital, Hachette Livre and various business angels, such as Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet, Micha\u00ebl Benabou and Octave Klaba.<\/p>\n<p>After turning Shadow into one of the most valuable French startups, Freund stepped back and took some time to think about his second act. He spent some time with his two children aged 5 and 8 years old.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI realized that code-learning tools for children are very lacking. So I turned to math because you don\u2019t need any support material. There are 40,000 apps but they all look like holiday workbooks,\u201d Freund told me.<\/p>\n<p>From his experience, most education apps are focused on one knowledge area in particular and are somewhat basic. According to him, education hasn\u2019t changed that much in the past 100 years. When you walk into a classroom, it still looks like a classroom.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, when you see a kid playing on Fortnite or Minecraft, chances are they\u2019re hooked. You tell them to come for dinner and they ask you for five more minutes of playtime.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we could build a sort of Ready Player One for education. An open world in which a child could learn new things,\u201d Freund said.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you can expect from PowerZ. First, it\u2019s not going to focus on one area in particular. You can learn history, geography, math, but also botanical knowledge, astronomy and poetry.<\/p>\n<p>Second, content isn\u2019t going to be gamified to motivate you to learn more to do more in the game. You\u2019ll be able to unlock some customizations but PowerZ is taking it easy with gamification.<\/p>\n<p>Third, the game will evolve depending on what you\u2019re doing. Some children will be better at math, others will be better at grammar. Some children like to learn new things in short sessions, others can remain focused for a while.

For a monthly subscription fee, you can access a gaming PC in a data center near you. Compared to other cloud gaming services, such as GeForce Now or Google\u2019s Stadia, Shadow provides a full Windows 10 instance. You can install anything you want \u2014 Steam, Photoshop or Word.<\/p>\n<p>The company has been growing rapidly over the past few years and raised more than $100 million in total. Last year, the company announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/shadow-announces-new-plans-for-its-cloud-gaming-platform\/\">ambitious plans<\/a>, with a wide-ranging partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ovhcloud.com\">OVHcloud<\/a> and high-end configurations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>At the same time, co-founder Emmanuel Freund stepped aside as CEO, with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Arnaud taking over. There have been multiple delays with the new product offering and the company is no longer working with OVHcloud. Freund left the company in April and, as INpact Hardware <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inpact-hardware.com\/article\/1962\/pc-dans-cloud-shadow-encore-retard-et-non-dit\">reported in July<\/a>, Arnaud has been on the way out for a couple of months.<\/p>\n<p>All of this leads us to today\u2019s announcement. Mike Fischer, the company\u2019s new CEO, has been quite active in the video game industry. In the past, he has worked at Sega, Bandai Namco, Microsoft and Epic Games. He was the president and CEO of Square Enix between 2010 and 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Jean-Baptiste Kempf is a well-known figure in the open-source community. For the past 14 years, he has been the president of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.videolan.org\">VideoLAN<\/a>, the organization behind popular media player VLC. VideoLAN has also contributed to widely used video encoding technologies. He also founded <a href=\"https:\/\/videolabs.io\">VideoLabs<\/a>, a company that works on VLC-related integrations and support.<\/p>\n<p>The company is still working on rolling out the new Ultra and Infinite configurations to European users who pre-ordered. It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/12\/cloud-gaming-platform-shadow-brings-its-new-plans-to-the-us\/\">originally planned<\/a> to start rolling out new tiers in the U.S. starting this summer but the company now says it expects to launch these new tiers by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>For customers in the U.S., there are no pre-orders, there will simply be a button to upgrade in your account when it\u2019s available. LG invested in the company earlier this year and the service will go live in South Korea later this year, as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are some changes at the helm of Blade, the French startup behind Shadow.

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is introducing a brand new Apple Watch at a cheaper price point. The new Apple Watch SE features the same design as the newly announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/\">Apple Watch Series 6<\/a>, but it costs $279.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe second thing we&#8217;re doing to make Apple Watch available to even more people is to create a new model that combines elements of Series 6 design with the most essential features of Apple Watch, all at a more affordable price,\u201d Apple COO Jeff Williams said.<\/p>\n<p>The Apple Watch SE uses the S5 system-on-a-chip, which was first released for the Apple Watch Series 5. However, it has the same, big display as the one on the Series 6. It also has the same accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and altimeter as the ones in the Series 6.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>And because the Apple Watch SE shares the same design as the Apple Watch Series 6, you can use the most recent complications and watch faces that are going to be introduced with watchOS 7.<\/p>\n<p>So we\u2019ll have to look at the tech specs in detail after Apple&#8217;s event, because the Apple Watch SE looks like a good deal when you compare it with the Apple Watch Series 6 that costs $399. You might not get blood oxygen data like on the Series 6, but it\u2019s a good watch for users who just want a watch to track their workouts, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is still keeping the Apple Watch Series 3 at the same price ($199). This device is a few years old now and it features the older screen design. So the Apple Watch Series 3 is not compatible with the most recent watch faces and complications.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also positioning the Apple Watch SE as a way to offer an Apple Watch to your kid. There\u2019s a cellular model, which means you can communicate with your kid without handing them a smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>The Apple Watch SE will be available on Friday. Pre-orders start today.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2046681\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Apple-Watch-SE_lineup.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"O2Z4VpWxOR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/\">The Apple Watch Series 6 arrives Friday, priced at $399<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Apple Watch Series 6 arrives Friday, priced at $399&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/15\/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6\/embed\/#?secret=O2Z4VpWxOR\" data-secret=\"O2Z4VpWxOR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/Apple-Hardware-Event-2020\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/apple-hardware-event-2020.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In addition to keeping older-generation devices at an entry-level price, Apple is introducing a brand new Apple Watch at a cheaper price point.

The Apple Watch Series 6 could feature some new tracking abilities, such as oxygen saturation. There should be a big emphasis on sleep tracking as well.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As for the iPad Air, Apple could unveil a big redesign. The new device could look more like the iPad Pro with slimmer bezels. But iPad Air users won\u2019t necessarily be getting Face ID, as the company has been working on integrating a Touch ID sensor in the power button. Let\u2019s see if Apple replaces the Lightning port with a USB-C port.<\/p>\n<p>What about the iPhone? Apple has been working hard on a new generation of smartphones, but the new iPhone might not be ready just yet. Apple has told shareholders that the release would occur a bit later than usual. Maybe the company will mention it, maybe not.<\/p>\n<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can download the Apple Events app in the App Store. It lets you stream today\u2019s event and rewatch old ones. The app icon was updated a few days ago for the event.<\/p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t have an Apple TV and don\u2019t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/livestream\/\">Apple Events section<\/a> on its website.

It lets you buy now and pay later over three or four installments with 0% interest. It has been quite popular in different European markets as many customers don\u2019t have credit cards and\/or don\u2019t want to pay the fees involved with revolving credit lines.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Merchants get paid when the initial transaction occurs, with Klarna transparently managing credit lines for customers. In addition to transaction fees, the company also generates revenue from late fees.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, the company expanded to the U.S., where it now has 9 million customers out of 90 million customers in total. It mainly competes with Affirm in the U.S. Klarna has also been expanding its offering by targeting consumers directly \u2014 not just e-commerce companies.<\/p>\n<p>You can now download the Klarna app to see all your Klarna payments, access a marketplace of stores, track deliveries and set up price-drop notifications. Using the app, you can also create virtual cards to pay with Klarna on unsupported stores, such as Amazon. It\u2019s not as straightforward as clicking Klarna when you check out, but it works. The app has 12 million monthly active users and 55,000 daily downloads.<\/p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/09\/klarna-launches-rewards-program\/\">launched a rewards program<\/a> this summer called Vibe. It is only available in the U.S. for now. It lets you earn points for every dollar you pay back on time when you use Klarna as your payment method. You can exchange points for gift cards at H&amp;M, Amazon, Walmart, Uber, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Klarna is now working with 200,000 retail partners, such as Sephora, Groupon and Ralph Lauren.

wants to let other companies offer financial services by issuing cards, bank accounts and IBANs with just a few lines of codes. The company could be considered as a bank-as-a-service platform, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.treezor.com\">Treezor<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarisbank.com\/en\/\">Solarisbank<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Originally founded by startup studio <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efounders.com\">eFounders<\/a>, the startup just raised a $5.9 million (\u20ac5 million) seed round led by Creandum with Bpifrance\u2019s Digital Venture fund also participating.<\/p>\n<p>Swan has obtained an e-money license from the French regulator, which lets them operate payment services and hold user funds. Unlike a bank, it can\u2019t issue credit lines. The company also handles risk, which means that it handles KYC processes (\u201cknow your customer\u201d). Essentially, if you\u2019re working with Swan, they take care of all the risky aspects of managing money.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Compared to other bank-as-a-service companies, Swan doesn\u2019t necessarily want to power neobanks and help them get started. The startup thinks a ton of companies touch on financial services but can\u2019t offer those services because it\u2019s such a big investment.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you can imagine an invoicing product that generates IBANs for you so that it automatically matches incoming transactions to the right invoice (like <a href=\"https:\/\/upflow.io\">Upflow<\/a>). On-demand companies could issue cards to their delivery <s>employees<\/s> partners so that they can pay for groceries and food directly using a Swan-powered card. Marketplace companies could handle pay-ins and pay-outs at a more granular level with each client managing their own e-money wallet.<\/p>\n<p>This vision is part of a bigger trend called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/learn-why-embedded-finance-is-the-future-of-fintech-at-disrupt\/\">embedded finance<\/a>. By expanding your product to control a bigger stack of the experience, you can provide new products and services and make your customers stick around for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>As a Swan customer, you can customize the branding with your own logo and colors. When you issue cards, you can choose between a physical Mastercard card or a virtual one. They work with Apple Pay and Google Pay. You pay \u20ac900 per month and a flat monthly fee for each account and card that you issue.<\/p>\n<p>Swan is taking a developer-oriented approach. The company says it can take several months to integrate a banking-as-a-service product into your own product.

You can connect your Qovery account with your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account so that it automatically gets triggered when you push new code.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After that, Qovery automatically spins up new servers, managed databases and brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for you. There are some ways to automate your deployment already with Terraform and continuous integration\/continuous delivery software. But Qovery makes it easy to get started.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, Qovery is building integrations with multiple cloud providers. It already works with Amazon Web Services and the team is currently working on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalocean.com\">DigitalOcean<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scaleway.com\/en\/\">Scaleway<\/a> support. Next up, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are on the road map.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, you can design your own infrastructure for each branch. For instance, if you have a development branch to try out new features or a staging branch, you can spin up new servers for this branch without having to recreate your production environment from the start.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s arguably Qovery\u2019s most important feature. According to the startup, cloud hosting will become commoditized. Each provider will provide managed databases, message brokers, etc. It comes down to reliability, pricing and support level. You can imagine having a production application on AWS and a development branch running on another cloud provider.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the scene, Qovery relies heavily on Terraform and Kubernetes, with an additional layer on top of them. When you compare it with Heroku\u2019s monolithic philosophy, it scales more efficiently, as it has been designed around micro-services from the ground up.<\/p>\n<p>Qovery costs $15 per application per month. Many companies have dozens of applications running at the same time to handle different parts of a service. So if you switch everything over to Qovery, you\u2019ll pay $15 for each application.<\/p>\n<p>If you already have a CI tool that works with your development team, you can use it instead of Qovery\u2019s built-in CI service. And there\u2019s no lock-in effect \u2014 you can stop using it if you now have your own DevOps team.<\/p>\n<p>The company has raised $1 million from Techstars and a long list of business angels.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2044179\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2044179\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2044179\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png 1456w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png?resize=150,105 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png?resize=300,210 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png?resize=768,538 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png?resize=680,476 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/from-git-to-cloud-with-Qovery.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2044179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Qovery<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember how Heroku was a big breakthrough when it was first released?

Many users have taken advantage of the service to travel and pay less in foreign exchange fees.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Users in Japan will also be able to create vaults and put some money aside by rounding up transactions and creating recurring transactions.

But there\u2019s no release date just yet.

on translation and localization of apps, websites, games and more. The company provides a software-as-a-service product that helps you improve your workflow and processes when you need to update text in different languages in your product.<\/p>\n<p>The company just raised a $6 million funding round led by Mike Chalfen, with capital300, Andrey Khusid, Nicolas Dessaigne, Des Traynor, Matt Robinson and others also participating.<\/p>\n<p>When it\u2019s time to ship an update, many companies waste time at the last minute as they still need to translate new buttons and new text in other languages. It\u2019s often a manual process that involves sending and incorporating files with long lists of text strings in different languages.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, the most popular tools used in localisation processes are still Excel and Google Sheets. Next come internally-built scripts and tools,\u201d co-founder and CEO Nick Ustinov told me.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lokalise-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lokalise-inc\">Lokalise <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is all about speeding up that process. You can either manually upload your language files or integrate directly with GitHub or GitLab so that it automatically fetches changes.<\/p>\n<p>You can then browse each sentence in different languages from the service. Your team of translators can edit text in the Lokalise interface. As a web-based service, everybody remains on the same page.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2039484\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039484\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039484\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg 2341w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=1536,961 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=2048,1281 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Lokalise_system_light_mode.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lokalise<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Some productivity features let you collaborate with other team members. You can comment and mention other people. You can assign tasks and trigger events based on completed tasks. For instance, Lokalise can notify a reviewer when a translation is done.<\/p>\n<p>When everything is completed, you can use Lokalise to dynamically deliver language files to your mobile apps using SDKs and an API, or you can simply upload to an object storage bucket so that your app can fetch the latest language file from a server.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a small company and don\u2019t have a team of translators, Lokalise lets you use Google Translate or a marketplace of professional translators. It works with <a href=\"https:\/\/gengo.com\">Gengo<\/a> or Lokalise\u2019s own marketplace. There are some built-in spelling and grammar features to help you spot the most obvious errors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost customers work with internal or external individual translators or language service providers (LSPs) directly,\u201d Ustinov said. \u201cThe SaaS product generates 90% of our revenue \u2014 the revenue breakdown between the SaaS product and the marketplace of translation services is 90%\/10%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The startup now has 1,500 customers, such as Revolut, Yelp, Virgin Mobile and Notion. It currently generates $4 million in annual recurring revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Lokalise solves a very specific need. It is probably overkill for many companies. But if you ship often and you have customers all around the world, it could speed up the process a little bit.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2039481\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039481\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"959\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg 1664w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=300,281 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=768,719 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=680,637 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1438 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Petr_Antropov_and_Nick_Ustinov_1-1.jpg?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039481\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lokalise<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Lokalise, a Latvian startup that focuses on translation and localization of apps, websites, games and more.

creates virtual offices so you can grab a room and talk with colleagues"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meet <a href=\"https:\/\/teemyco.com\">Teemyco<\/a>, a Stockholm-based startup that wants to reproduce office interactions in a virtual environment. The company wants to foster spontaneous interactions and casual collaboration with a room-based interface. Each employee moves from one room to another just like in a physical office.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re no longer working from an office, chances are you rely heavily on email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet or a combination of all those tools. While those tools work perfectly fine for what they\u2019re designed to achieve, many companies feel like important information is getting lost. It\u2019s harder to bump into a colleague next to the coffee machine and ask a quick question.<\/p>\n<p>With Teemyco, each person is working in a virtual room. By default, you work in the lobby. You can consider it as an open space with multiple desks. When you want to get together for a planned or unplanned meeting, you can pull someone from the lobby and create another room.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In that room, you can start an audio call or a video call. You can see your colleagues in the corner of your screen and stay focused on a document at the same time, or you can put a video call in full screen. When someone is done, they can leave the room.<\/p>\n<p>Those interactions are less formal than what you get with video-conferencing services. You don\u2019t have to send a link to a Zoom room, you don\u2019t have to send a calendar invite. People hop in and hop out.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re working on something important, you can move to a focus room so that you don\u2019t get interrupted every 15 minutes. Other people won\u2019t be able to pull you from your virtual desk. If you have to run some errands, you can also put yourself in a room that says you\u2019re not there \u2014 those rooms can act as a status.<\/p>\n<p>Teemyco also helps you work next to your favorite colleague. You can create a room and use a walkie-talkie feature for quick interactions throughout the day. And, of course, you can create a break room for non-work-related discussions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IsYtBd-aUxc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Teemyco is still a young company. The product is only available in beta. The company raised a $1 million seed round led by Luminar Ventures with Antler, Gazella and various business angels also participating.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also not going to work for all companies. I\u2019m not sure it scales well for a company with hundreds of employees, for instance. Introverts might not be fans of real-time communication either.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a remote-first company, you know that it\u2019s important to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/18\/how-a-culture-of-transparency-helps-you-manage-a-remote-team\/\">culture of transparency<\/a>. And written information is always more transparent than video conferences.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, depending on your corporate culture, something like Teemyco can be useful. It can augment information stored in shared documents and internal communication tools.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an interesting product that proves that the inevitable debate between physical offices and remote teams is not a binary problem. There is some granularity, and companies can adjust the knob depending on specific needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Teemyco, a Stockholm-based startup that wants to reproduce office interactions in a virtual environment.
