Most
Supreme
Court
appointees
since
1969—15
of
19—were
nominated
by
Republicans
,
but
conservatives
have
fallen
short
of
fully
displacing
numerous
progressive
legal
doctrines
that
took
hold
in
the
1930s
and
flowered
in
the
1950s
and
’
60s
under
Chief
Justice
Earl
Warren
.
Since
that
era
,
liberals
have
largely
maintained
a
durable
minority
of
four
votes
,
slowing
the
court
’
s
move
to
the
right
and
sporadically
able
to
secure
5-4
victories
when
a
single
conservative
’
s
views
overlapped
their
own.

The
death
of
Justice
Ruth
Bader

gave
conservatives
an
opportunity
to
cement
their
dominance

Judge
Barrett
,
whom
picked
to
fill
the
vacancy
on
Saturday
,
appears
tailor-made
for
a
mission
many
conservatives
hope
will
redefine
constitutional
interpretation.

Like
Justice
Scalia
,
Judge
Barrett
is
known
as
an
originalist
and
a
textualist—that
is
,
she
applies
the
Constitution
according
to
her
understanding
of
what
its
language
meant
when
adopted
,
and
when
interpreting
statutes
she
zeroes
in
on
the
text
of
legislation
rather
than
the
purpose
lawmakers
were
trying
to
achieve.
< /p>
< p>
“
Speculating
about
congressional
desires
is
a
dicey
enterprise
,
which
is
one
reason
among
many
that
we
should
stick
to
the
text
,
”
Judge
Barrett
wrote
earlier
this
month
.
She
was
dissenting
from
a
decision
that
allowed
a
defendant
who
hadn
’
t
been
sentenced
before
President
Trump
signed
a
law
reducing
some
sentences
to
benefit
from
the
law
’
s
more
lenient
punishments.

Originalism
and
textualism
have
been
championed
by
conservatives
as
methods
to
rein
in
liberal
jurisprudence
that
reads
constitutional
rights
expansively.
< /p>
< p>
Judge
Barrett
’
s
scholarly
and
judicial
record
suggests
her
jurisprudence
would
produce
conservative
results
.
As
a
result
of
a
third
Trump
appointee
,
“
There
could
be
some
lean
years
,
more
lean
years
for
progressives
,
”
said
former
Sen.
Russ
Feingold
(
D.
,
Wis.
)
,
president
of
the
liberal
American
Constitution
Society
.
At
age
48
,
Judge
Barrett
could
serve
through
mid-century.
< /p>
< p>
Nominated
by
Mr.
Trump
to
the
Chicago-based
Seventh
U.S
.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
in
2017
,
Judge
Barrett
was
confirmed
after
a
contentious
hearing
where
some
Democratic
senators
questioned
whether
her
Catholic
faith
would
intrude
on
secular
legal
decisions.
< /p>
< p>
“
It
’
s
never
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
impose
that
judge
’
s
personal
convictions
,
whether
they
derive
from
faith
or
anywhere
else
,
on
the
law
,
”
she
said.
< /p>
< p>
< strong>
< /strong>
< /p>
< p>
Pressed
by
Sen.
Dianne
Feinstein
(
D.
,
Calif.
)
to
say
whether
she
would
uphold
Roe
v.
Wade
,
the
1973
decision
recognizing
a
woman
’
s
right
to
end
a
pregnancy
,
then-Prof.
Barrett
said
,
“
I
’
m
being
considered
for
a
position
on
a
court
of
appeals
,
and
there
would
be
no
opportunity
to
be
a
no
vote
on
Roe.
”
< /p>
< p>
On
the
Supreme
Court
,
which
alone
has
the
power
to
reconsider
its
precedents
,
there
might
be
.
“
If
we
put
another
two
or
perhaps
three
justices
on
,
that
will
happen
,
”
then-candidate
Trump
said
in
a
2016
debate
when
asked
about
overturning
the
decision
.
“
And
that
will
happen
automatically
,
in
my
opinion
,
because
I
am
putting
pro-life
justices
on
the
court.
”
< /p>
< p>
Judge
Barrett
hasn
’
t
written
an
opinion
on
abortion
but
has
cast
votes
indicating
she
is
,
at
minimum
,
skeptical
of
the
scope
of
rights
as
Justice
Ginsburg
and
other
liberals
have
seen
them.
< /p>
< p>
Last
year
,
Judge
Barrett
was
one
of
five
judges
to
dissent
when
the
full
Seventh
Circuit
declined
to
reconsider
a
three-judge
panel
’
s
ruling
that
blocked
a
parental-notification
law
in
Indiana
.
The
dissenters
questioned
the
propriety
of
federal
courts
blocking
state
abortion
laws
before
they
go
into
effect.
< /p>
< p>
In
2018
,
she
joined
a
dissent
expressing
doubts
about
a
ruling
that
struck
down
an
Indiana
provision
barring
abortion
if
a
woman
wants
to
end
a
pregnancy
solely
because
of
the
sex
or
disability
of
the
fetus
.
None
of
the
Supreme
Court
’
s
past
abortion
rulings
held
that
states
were
powerless
to
prevent
abortions
designed
to
choose
the
sex
,
race
and
other
attributes
of
children
,
the
dissenters
argued.

The
Supreme
Court
has
been
on
a
rightward
trajectory
particularly
since
the
conservative
Justice
Samuel
Alito
succeeded
center-right
Reagan
appointee
Sandra
Day
O
’
Connor
in
2006
.
The
court
’
s
conservative
wing
has
outvoted
liberals
to
carve
out
religious
exemptions
from
federal
laws
;
to
strike
down
campaign-finance
regulations
as
violations
of
the
First
Amendment
;
and
to
allow
gerrymanders
under
the
view
there
was
no
way
to
determine
when
a
partisan
legislature
had
gone
too
far.
< /p>
< p>
In
recent
years
,
Chief
Justice
John
Roberts
has
been
the
conservative
most
likely
to
join
the
liberal
wing
in
a
5-4
vote—such
as
in
helping
invalidate
a
Louisiana
abortion
restriction
in
the
last
court
term—but
he
isn
’
t
the
only
one
.
Justice
Clarence
Thomas
provided
a
fifth
vote
to
liberals
in
a
2015
decision
letting
Texas
exclude
the
Sons
of
Confederate
Veterans
from
a
commemorative
license-plate
program
,
notes
John
Malcolm
,
director
of
the
Meese
Center
for
Legal
and
Judicial
Studies
at
the
Heritage
Foundation.
< /p>
< p>
“
At
any
given
time
,
the
liberal
bloc
of
the
court
has
been
able
to
peel
away
a
justice
from
the
conservative
bloc
,
”
Mr.
Malcolm
said
.
With
a
Justice
Barrett
,
“
the
liberal
bloc
can
peel
one
of
those
justices
away
,
but
...
you
still
have
a
5-4
majority
for
the
conservatives.
”
Thus
,
a
third
Trump
appointee
,
after
Justices
Neil
Gorsuch
and
Brett
Kavanaugh
,
could
lock
in
conservative
outcomes
across
the
board.
< /p>
< p>
< strong>
< /strong>
< /p>
< p>
Judge
Barrett
’
s
known
views
fall
to
the
right
of
the
two
prior
Trump
appointees
,
and
somewhat
to
the
left
of
Justices
Thomas
and
Alito
,
according
to
an
analysis
of
judicial
ideology
by
researchers
at
Washington
University
in
St.
Louis
and
the
University
of
Michigan
.
As
a
result
,
the
court
’
s
“
median
justice
,
”
currently
Chief
Justice
Roberts
,
would
shift
rightward
to
Justice
Kavanaugh
,
said
one
of
the
study
’
s
authors
,
Lee
Epstein
,
a
political
scientist
and
law
professor
at
Washington
University.
< /p>
< p>
Still
,
once
appointed
to
their
life-tenured
seats
,
some
justices
have
deviated
from
their
ideological
paths
.
Justice
Ginsburg
’
s
predecessor
,
Justice
Byron
White
,
an
appointee
of
President
Kennedy
,
sometimes
joined
conservatives
,
for
example
in
dissent
from
Roe
.
Justice
David
Souter
,
appointed
by
President
George
H.W
.
Bush
,
failed
to
perform
an
expected
about-face
from
the
liberal
champion
he
succeeded
,
William
Brennan.
< /p>
< p>
A
central
issue
for
a
6-3
court
would
be
how
often—and
how
quickly—it
might
move
to
reconsider
some
of
the
court
’
s
past
rulings
that
are
viewed
with
disfavor
in
conservative
legal
circles
.
Justices
can
not
overrule
past
precedent
in
a
vacuum
because
they
want
to
go
in
a
new
direction
.
Litigants
would
first
have
to
bring
cases
that
raised
such
issues
,
and
the
court
would
have
to
agree
to
hear
them.
< /p>
< p>
It
’
s
uncertain
how
a
new-look
court
would
approach
stare
decisis
,
the
legal
doctrine
that
promotes
stability
in
the
law
by
adhering
to
precedent
,
even
if
later-arriving
judges
would
have
decided
the
issue
differently
.
The
phrase
is
Latin
for
standing
by
what
has
been
decided.

Accustomed
to
playing
defense
,
liberal
justices
have
been
asserting
the
sanctity
of
precedent
for
years
.
“
Respecting
stare
decisis
means
sticking
to
some
wrong
decisions
,
”
Justice
Elena
Kagan
wrote
in
a
2015
opinion
.
“
Correct
judgments
have
no
need
for
that
principle
to
prop
them
up.
”
< /p>
< p>
Chief
Justice
Roberts
has
followed
some
precedents
he
says
were
wrongly
decided
,
asserting
that
a
swing
in
legal
interpretations
with
each
change
in
personnel
would
make
the
court
resemble
a
political
institution
rather
than
a
judicial
body
.
By
contrast
,
Justice
Thomas
has
argued
that
precedents
should
be
discarded
if
they
run
counter
to
his
view
of
the
Constitution
’
s
original
meaning.
< /p>
< p>
Judge
Barrett
has
at
times
been
critical
of
stare
decisis
.
In
a
2003
law
review
article
,
she
suggested
the
doctrine
can
deprive
individuals
of
due-process
rights
by
making
it
difficult
to
challenge
legal
precedents
they
believe
are
wrong.
< /p>
< p>
Although
Judge
Barrett
has
a
limited
judicial
record
,
some
of
her
opinions
,
as
well
as
her
writings
as
a
law
professor
,
help
flesh
out
her
views
.
In
one
key
contrast
with
Justice
Ginsburg
,
Judge
Barrett
has
voiced
a
more
expansive
reading
of
the
Second
Amendment
’
s
protections
of
the
right
to
bear
arms.
< /p>
< p>
Supreme
Court
5-to-4
decisions
in
2008
and
2010
recognized
an
individual
’
s
right
to
keep
a
handgun
for
self-defense
.
The
court
has
declined
to
take
up
a
major
gun
case
ever
since
,
while
lower
courts
upheld
the
vast
majority
of
state
and
local
laws
regulating
arms
and
ammunition
,
even
though
four
justices—Thomas
,
Alito
,
Gorsuch
and
Kavanaugh—are
known
to
hold
broad
views
of
the
Second
Amendment.

Last
year
,
Judge
Barrett
opposed
a
categorical
ban
on
gun
possession
by
convicted
felons
,
dissenting
in
a
case
involving
a
white-collar
defendant
convicted
of
Medicare
fraud
.
She
said
the
government
should
have
to
demonstrate
that
felons
are
actually
dangerous
before
stripping
them
of
their
right
to
own
a
gun.
< /p>
< p>
“
Founding-era
legislatures
did
not
strip
felons
of
the
right
to
bear
arms
simply
because
of
their
status
as
felons
,
”
she
wrote.
< /p>
< p>
Her
Second
Amendment
test
in
that
case
,
by
emphasizing
the
importance
of
historical
practices
,
could
make
it
harder
for
gun
regulations
to
pass
muster
than
under
the
approach
used
by
most
lower
courts
,
which
examines
whether
the
regulation
burdens
a
Second
Amendment
right
and
,
if
so
,
whether
the
burden
is
justified
by
public-safety
concerns.
< /p>
< p>
Elsewhere
,
Judge
Barrett
’
s
opinions
have
shown
a
belief
that
the
executive
branch
has
wide
latitude
in
setting
immigration
policy
.
She
wrote
in
a
dissent
this
year
that
the
Trump
administration
had
the
authority
to
enforce
a
rule
that
makes
it
easier
to
deny
limited-income
immigrants
residency
because
they
might
use
public-assistance.
< /p>
< p>
She
noted
that
critics
have
labeled
the
administration
’
s
approach
as
too
harsh
,
but
the
same
could
be
said
about
the
immigration
laws
passed
by
Congress
,
she
said
,
adding
:
“
Litigation
is
not
the
vehicle
for
resolving
policy
disputes.
”
< /p>
< p>
In
a
2019
case
,
after
a
consular
officer
denied
a
visa
to
a
Yemeni
woman
whose
husband
was
a
U.S.
citizen
,
Judge
Barrett
wrote
a
majority
opinion
rejecting
a
challenge
to
the
consular
officer
’
s
decision
.
She
said
courts
have
almost
no
room
to
second-guess
those
determinations
under
federal
law
,
making
consular
decisions
unreviewable
.
Dissenters
argued
that
the
husband
had
a
due
process
right
at
least
to
know
the
factual
basis
for
excluding
his
wife.
< /p>
< p>
Like
Justice
Scalia
’
s
,
Judge
Barrett
’
s
approach
to
criminal
procedure
could
sometimes
benefit
defendants
through
strict
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights
to
confrontation
of
prosecution
witnesses
and
protection
from
unreasonable
searches.
< /p>
< p>
< strong data-stringify-type= '' bold ''>
< /strong>
< /p>
< p>
But
she
has
been
reluctant
to
let
federal
judges
set
aside
state-court
convictions
because
of
alleged
constitutional
deficiencies
,
saying
federal
courts
must
be
deferential
to
state
criminal
proceedings.
< /p>
< p>
In
the
case
of
a
man
convicted
of
attempted
murder
,
she
acknowledged
that
Indiana
prosecutors
had
withheld
information
that
would
have
helped
his
defense
,
but
maintained
in
a
dissent
that
Indiana
courts
had
not
been
so
egregiously
wrong
as
to
justify
reversing
the
conviction.
< /p>
< p>
At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
,
Judge
Barrett
has
voted
to
suppress
evidence
for
police
violations
of
suspects
’
rights
.
She
wrote
an
opinion
tossing
a
conviction
for
unlawful
gun
possession
,
saying
an
anonymous
911
call
from
a
teenager
didn
’
t
give
police
reasonable
suspicion
to
block
a
car
in
a
parking
lot
where
the
gun
was
found.
< /p>
< p>
And
in
yet
another
case
,
she
said
Drug
Enforcement
Agency
agents
wrongly
searched
an
alleged
heroin
dealer
’
s
house
based
on
consent
they
got
from
a
woman
in
a
bathrobe
who
they
assumed
lived
there
but
actually
didn
’
t.
< /p>
< p>
“
The
officers
could
reasonably
assume
that
the
woman
had
spent
the
night
at
the
apartment
,
but
that
’
s
about
as
far
as
a
bathrobe
could
take
them
,
”
Judge
Barrett
wrote
.
Under
the
Fourth
Amendment
,
she
concluded
,
the
agents
had
conducted
an
unreasonable
search.
